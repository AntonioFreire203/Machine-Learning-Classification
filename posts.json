        "selftext": "I've heard it said many times that \"Indonesian is easy\" (especially for native English speakers) and I just don't know why people say that. For context I am a native English speaker who is semi fluent in Spanish, so I'm not completely green when it comes to learning languages. \n\nI decided to Learn Indonesian because I'm moving there in January. I completely bought into the stuff I read about it being \"easy\" and I completely disagree with that assertion. Sure, the grammar is relatively simple but the formal and informal variations are a pain in the ass and using the wrong form in speech can make you look like an idiot. \n\nI believe when people say Indo is easy they don't look at it from the perspective of being in the country, speaking to natives. (Everyone is different) The speed of the spoken language is on par with that Mexican Spanish and the words are incredibly long, which is compounded by the amount of them that begin with the letter \"M\". Idk how many times I have mixed words up simply because of that alone, especially when it's in the heat of a conversation. \n\nIndonesian, like Spanish has many different dialects not only within the same island, but in each of the separate islands as well. However, where it differs in that regard is the fact that not only do words completely change but often the natives will integrate the native languages into their Indonesian, alot of the time it could be upwards of 70% of the conversation. It could be Javanese or Sumatran with the remaining being their own variation of Bahasa Indonesian. Something like this: \"Injavvvvvvvvvvinnnjavvvvvinjavvvvvvvv\". That is probably a terrible way to explain what I'm trying to say. Hopefully you understand.\n\nNot to mention the many different variations of a way to say a sentence. I have 3 tutors and they're all from different islands. 1 is from Bali, one is from Sumatra and the other Java. I had such a difficult time initially because they all spoke a completely different version of the language because of the stuff I said above but unlike Spanish, their dialect of Bahasa was not intelligible to me and it's not because I'm at the elementary level. I can carry minor conversations. I had them all join a call with me and they all struggled understanding each other. It was actually hilarious to participate in. \n\nLong story short, I think Bahasa Indonesia is more suited as a level 4 language rather than a 3, or if there could be a scale maybe a 3.8 out of 5. Its definitely not as simple as it's made out to be. \n\nSorry for the long post.",

The same is true in many other Latin American dialects of Spanish, but is more pronounced in the two above. This leads me to my question:\n\nAre there any dialects of Spanish that pronounce their \"C\" in any context with a  /\u02a7/ or \"ch\" sound?

Or is the 650 something hours referring to someone who never studied the language before nor any other Romance language and basically his or her first few hours logged in would be taking say Italian 1 or hiring some neighbors who immigrated from Colombia for informal private lessons?\n\nOr is it something else?

To be honest I started thinking I had something wrong with me and for some reason maybe I can't learn a language. And I still feel a little bit this way. I thought about my goals and added a Chinese language minor this is a language I really want to learn. I will be starting a 101 class soon. What advice can you give me to prepare myself or what can I do during the class generally to make sure I do well? Do you have any tricks or approaches you took while learning a language in school that could help me as someone struggling with languages? I have to have some accountability so I will be honest, I did horrible studying the languages and maybe didn't do it enough. I don't know how to properly study languages and this left me with days of not studying because there was so much info I didn't know what was priority. I am hoping third time is the charm though.",

        "title": "Indo-European *nebh- & *newn Reconsidered",
        "selftext": "Latin n\u016bbs / n\u016bb\u0113s \u2018cloud\u2019 seems to come from \\*neubh-s (related to \\*(s)neu- / \\*(s)naHu- / \\*(s)neudh- / \\*(s)neug\\^h- \u2018wet\u2019).  The plural form would be commonly used of clouds, since a loan cloud is more rare, then becoming sng. by joining the \u0113-stems after \\*-es > -\u0113s (analogical to pl. of i-stems).  This allows Skt. fem. pl. n\u0101\u0301bhas \u2018clouds\u2019 to come from the same source.  If \\*neubh-s / \\*newbh-s became \\*navbhs / \\*na:bhs, \\*navps / \\*na:ps or similar, the loss of \\*v with lengthening of V would have no counterevidence.  This could be part of dissimilation of PP, often > TP (so possibly also vps > zps > sps > \\_ps ).  Similar types of changes to \\*nawbhs, etc., would be possible, merely worded differently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no difference in meaning between \\*newbh- and \\*nebh-, \\*nembh-, \\*nem-, etc., all \u2018(rain)cloud / sky / etc.\u2019 (G. n\u00e9phos \u2018cloud\u2019, OCS nebo \u2018sky\u2019, H. n\u0113pis, OIr nem \u2018sky/heaven\u2019, L. nimbus \u2018cloud\u2019, MP nam(b) \u2018moist\u2019).  It makes sense that they also lost \\*w through a similar process, or turned it to \\*m.  The ( irregular ) change of \\*w > m near W / w / u is common in IE (Skt. -vant- / -mant-, L. vehere \u2018lead/bring/travel\u2019, \\*vehevent- > vehement- (Whalen, 2024a)).  These might be due to nasalized sonorants, since IIr. words seem to have nasals appear from nowhere near \\*v and \\*y, and some even have nasal y\\~ (Whalen, 2023).  These irregularities are concentrated in \\*ne(w/m)bh-, so a phonological explanation makes more sense than several types of analogy that happened to affect the same word in similar ways in different branches.  There is little reason for \\*nebhos- to become \\*nemos- in Celtic under the influence of identical \\*nem-, etc., as \u2018(holy) grove\u2019 just because both might be sacred.  Less likely still when \\*nembh- exists.  The loss of \\*-w- and gain of \\*-m- should be related, considering clear w / m elsehwere.  Not all -N- are due to nasal infixes.  The specifics of these changes below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLatin Nept\u016bnus has been compared to Greek Poseid\u00f4n, a god of the sea associated with horses.  The ending -\u016bnus is uncommon, and not seen in other likely cognates (Old Irish Nechtan, husband of (the river) Boand).  If from older \\*newbh-to- \u2018wet\u2019 that formed \\*newbh-ton- / \\*newbh-t(o)no- (found in similar names of gods), metathesis in \\*newbhtono- > \\*nebhtowno- > Nept\u016bnus would work.  Similarly, if \\*newbhton- > \\*nebhtwon- with weak stem \\*nebhtun-, metathesis in \\*nebhtun- > \\*nentubh-s > \\*nentu-s > \\*nertu-s > ON Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r.  There is no other ex. of \\*-ps, etc., in Gmc., and n-n > n-r is common.  Celtic \\*n(e)udont- > British Nodont- \\\\ Nodent- \\\\ Nudent- (a god of healing/sea, seen in hunt/dogs), OIr Nuadu Airgetl\u00e1m could be from \\*(s)neudh- of the same meaning.  Even sound changes d(h) / b(h) are possible, if all the same (Whalen, 2024b).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe god Ap\u0101\u0301m N\u00e1p\u0101t is also associated with horses & might have had a name meaning \u2018lord of waters\u2019.  The Sanskrit voc. n\u00e1bh-r\u0101j \u2018lord of rain(clouds)?\u2019 used in a series of invocations of unknown gods (or epithets for known gods) makes it likely that a similar formation is behind it.  Since in Sanskrit the sounds p / b / bh became d before bh and t before p, \\*n\u00e9bh-p\u014dt(i)- > \\*n\u00e1bh-p\u0101t \u2018lord of waters\u2019 would become \\*n\u00e1t-p\u0101t and dissimilation of t-t > 0-t could create \\*N\u00e1tp\u0101t > Ap\u0101\u0301m N\u00e1p\u0101t.  Gods are often called \u2018lord\u2019, seldom \u2018nephew\u2019.  The timing of this allows a Proto-Indo-Iranian explanation as well.  It is very unlikely that the word n\u00e1bh-r\u0101j would exist without explanation but be clarified by this origin of \\*n\u00e1bh-p\u0101t if it were not true.  The existence of a god parallel to Nept\u016bnus / Poseid\u00f4n who was a lord of waters without the presence of a word meaning \u2018lord of waters\u2019 at some point seems impossible; this word seems to fit, and if it doesn\u2019t, such a word would have been lost without a trace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith \\*newbh- as the oldest form in mind, the similar oddity of n- vs. m- in L. mef\u012btis \u2018poisonous gas from swamp/volcano\u2019 (likely from Samnite) can also be solved.  If \\*newbh- > \\*nwebh-, then \\*nw- > \\*mw- could create \\*mebh- > mef-.  Though many gaps exist in PIE Cw- and Cy-, I see evidence for them in alternations that they produced (Whalen, 2024c).  This includes even clear variants showing both, with many Cy- / C- optional:  \\*myazdha- > Skt. m\u00e9dha- / miy\u00e9dha- \u2018sacrificial rite / offering (of food) / holiness\u2019, Av. miyazda- \u2018sacrificial meal\u2019; \\*py- > pt- / p- in many Greek words.  It is directly seen in many Arm. words:  \\*pH2trwyo- > \\*patrwo- > \\*patrow- > L. patruus \u2018father\u2019s brother\u2019, G. patrui\u00f3s \u2018stepfather\u2019, Arm. yawray.  Old \\*py- here also seen in Iranian \\*p(i)tar-, with completely unexplained and completely ignored optional -i-.  These have been ignored by linguists because most new work only focuses on building on the past, not looking to change accepted doctrine with the new eyes of someone familiar with modern methods.  The first work on IE was important, but ignored many oddities if there was no attested cause; modern linguists know some sounds and clusters exist but can disappear, only apparent in effects on other remaining sounds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith clusters like this \\*nw- / \\*mw-, why should \\*n- > d- not be related, too?  In Li. debes\u00ecs, Luw. tappas there is no reason for this apparent change.  If these also came from \\*nw-, the motivation could be optional \\*w > \\*xW / \\*\u03b3W / \\*RW (Whalen, 2024d).  When \\*w became an obstruent, \\*nRW- was impossible, so > \\*dRW-.  As I said, there\u2019s no reason for these irregularities to be concentrated in \\*ne(w/m)bh- instead of other words for \u2018sky\u2019, other words with n-, other words with pairs/opposites, or any group of words.  Why would \\*n- become d- in 2 distinct groups if it was an analogical change?  Since it is not regular, or only happened in some languages in each branch, it can\u2019t be inherited analogy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the same way, optional d- in Balto-Slavic \\*nebhos / \\*debhos \u2018sky\u2019 is matched by \\*newn / \\*dewn \u2018nine\u2019.  If analogy, there would be no reason for \u2018sky\u2019 to show the same.  Both roots contain \\*-w-.  If from the same cause, PIE \\*enwewm / \\*emwewn / etc. could produce -n- vs. -nn- in :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG. enn\u00e9a, Arm. inn, Khowar ny\u00f2f \u20199\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG. en(n)\u00e1kis / ein\u00e1kis \u2018nine times\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe change of \\*enw- > enn- / ein- in G. seems regular.  R\u00e9my Viredaz pointed out (pc) that G. data would be expected from \\*nw.  Having one explanation for \\*nw- > d- and \\*-nw- > -nn- / -\\_n- is preferable, and that \\*w also disappears in \\*ne(w)bh- (sometimes with the same \\*n- > d- ) shows the cause.  Most IE would dissimilate w-w in \\*enwewn > \\*enewn, Kh. had w-w > y-w for \\*nwaw- > \\*nyav > ny\u00f2f.  Arm. inn unexpectedly lost \\*-w-, not > -g-, but it would be expected if it dissimilated w-w in \\*enwewn > \\*enwen > \\*inwin > \\*inin, which also makes sense of all these oddities in roots with \\*w.  Alternation of n / m by m / n is common (Whalen, 2024e), so having both \\*-m / \\*-n and \\*-nw- / \\*-mw- here is no problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Hnomn-ye- \u2018name\u2019 >> G. onoma\u00edn\u014d, Go. namnjan, \\*nammjan > \\*n\u014dmjan > OF n\u00f3mia\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*men- \u2018think\u2019 > \\*men-mn > Skt. m\u00e1nman- \u2018thought/mind\u2019, OIr menme\n\n\\*men-mn-yo-s \u2018wise\u2019 > \\*memniyo-s > \\*mimnija-z > \\*mimmija-z > \\*m\u012bmija-z > ON M\u00edmir\n\n(or directly from perfect \\*me-mon- / \\*me-mn- \u2018have thought/known > remember / be wise/knowledgeable\u2019 )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmaybe n-mn > n-mm > n-\\_m (explaining optional lengthening of the vowel and loss of n at the same time).

D\u012b Nov\u0113nsid\u0113s \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs further evidence of PIE \\*enwewm / \\*emwewn \u20189\u2019, consider that many languages have phrases for \u2018one less\u2019 used for \u20189\u2019 if \u201910\u2019 exists, for \u20184\u2019 if \u20185\u2019 is the highest named number.  This makes Anatolian \\*mewo- > H. meyawa\u0161 / \\*m\u0113was \u20184\u2019, Luw.  mauwa-, which seem to come from a word for \u2018less\u2019 the best evidence.  It is unlikely that \\*mewo- would be used for \u2018less than 5\u2019 and \\*newn / \\*newm for \u2018less than 10\u2019 within one language by chance.  With my \\*enwewm / \\*emwewn / \\*emwewm / \\*enwewn, having original \\*emwewo- for \u20184\u2019 and \\*emwewm for \u20189\u2019 would solve both problems.  It is likely \\*-m in \u20189\u2019 is analogical to \\*-m in \u201910\u2019, etc.  This would make sense if \u20189\u2019 was formed later than \u20184\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not only \u20189\u2019.  The reconstruction of PIE \\*dek\\^m(t) \u201810\u2019 does not fit all data.  In supposed \\*dek\\^m \u201810\u2019 > \\*dzek\u00e4m > TA \u015b\u00e4k, there is palatal \u015b- instead of expected ts-.  This makes sense if really \\*dyek\\^m > \\*dzyek\u00e4m > \\*zyek\u00e4m > \\*\u017aek\u00e4m > TA \u015b\u00e4k.  More direct evidence exists in IIr.  Kh. retained \\*dy-, when most IE > \\*d- :\n\n\\*dyek\\^m(t) > \\*dya\u0107a > Kh. j\u00f2\u0161 \u201810\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther IIr. oddities in \u201910\u2019 might have the same source.  Older \\*da\u0161i is given for Sh. d\u00e1i, D. d\u00e9e, Id. d\u028c\\`y\u0161I (in Zoller), maybe showing IIr. \\*ya, then with metathesis \\*dya\u015ba > \\*da\u015bya to put palatal by palatal.  It probably is behind (optional?) \\*-d(y)a\u015b\u00e0 > Dm. -(t)aa\u0161 \\\\ -(y)ee\u0161 \u2018-teen\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not only good for Dardic:  Nuristani also shows \\*a > e or u in \u201910\u2019, unexplained if originally simply \\*a-a in supposed IIr. \\*da\u015ba.  Instead, \\*dyek\\^mt > \\*dya\u0107mt > \\*da\u0107ymt > \\*da\u0107imt > \\*da\u0107iwt > \\*da\u0107\u00fc > \\*d\u00f6\u0107\u00fc > \\*doc > Kv. duts, \\*d\u00f6c\u00fc > \\*dedzi > Prasun lez, etc.  This is even seen in the edges of Iran, like the Pamir group:  \\*da\u0107\u00fc > \\*dasu > Bartangi \u00f0us, \\*da\u0107\u00fc > \\*dasi > Shu. \u00f0is, Sar. \u00f0Es.  It is pointless to try to explain so many oddities in \u2018ten\u2019 as unmotivated alterations to \\*dek\\^mt when there is no evidence that this was the oldest form.  It is merely an approximation based on a sample of data, whatever linguists could explain without resorting to C\u2019s that usually disappeared.  We now know that such C\u2019s disappearing in all or most descendants is common throughout the world\u2019s languages.  Do not remain stuck in the past, but look at new data afresh and use it to improve PIE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn compounds, Latin has -decim, Celtic has \\*-deamk > OIr deac / de\u00ebc, MIr -d\u00e9c, Ir. -d\u00e9ag, W. deng \u2018-teen\u2019.  In standard theory, deac is explained by \\*dek\\^m-kWe \u2018\\_ and ten\u2019 > \\*dekamke > \\*-deamk.  This would not work for W. deng, since it had \\*kW > p.  There is also little motivation to dissimilate k-mkW > 0-mkW (instead of > k-m, removing the otherwise unseen C-cluster) or to create a sequence of V1-V2 at a time when it presumably did not otherwise exist.  L. -decim is explained by unstressed \\*e > \\*i, ten metathesis (\\*-dekem > \\*-dikem > \\*-dekim ).  Likewise, there is little motivation to do so.  If this was to make \\*-dikem more like plain \\*dekem, changing the V alone (as done in some other compounds) would be sufficient.  There is no good reason for these separate branches to show 2 separate very odd changes to \u201810' .  Other IE cognates show oddities as well (see below), which make it likely there is a problem with the reconstruction itself.  Instead of asking why \\*dek\\^m(t) became many things that would not come from \\*dek\\^m(t) by known changes, linguists should consider that they might have been wrong 200 years ago.  New data from languages not described then has made the simple reconstruction unmotivated, an artifact of looking at only a subset of languages, and not even explaining all outcomes in those.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany of these problems can be solved by metathesis of \\*dyek\\^m(t) \u201810\u2019 instead .  Here, metathesis \\*dyek\\^mt > \\*dyek\\^emt > \\*dek\\^yemt > \\*dekyem > -decim would work.  This could be motivated by putting palatal \\*k\\^ and \\*y together at a stage when \\*dy- was becoming \\*d- in most IE.  A second (if it was closely related to Italic) metathesis in Celtic of \\*dek\\^yamt > \\*deyamk could be motivated by \\*-mt > \\*-m\\_ (with \\*k filling the mora).  If old it could have happened before \\*m > \\*Vm (and this might work for others too, if optional for both \u2018ten\u2019 and \u2018-teen\u2019).  If more restricted, a shift of stress in \u201811\u2019, etc., removing it from \\*y\u00e9-m > \\*ye-m\u00b4.  If in Italo-Celtic only stressed syllables had the form of CyV, others Ci(y)V, this would be explained.  The full scope is not certain, but I favor optionality across all or most IE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptional change of \\*dye- > \\*dya- (maybe for any \\*-yek\\^- / \\*-yak\\^- ) might also explain:\n\n\\*dyak\\^m(t) \u2018ten\u2019 > Armenian tasn\n\n\\*dyak\\^mt-lo- > \\*daktm-lo- > \\*daktu-lo- > Greek d\u00e1ktulos \u2018finger / toe\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis also allows a better expl. of how \u2018toe\u2019 & \u2018ten\u2019 were related in Gmc. :\n\n\\*dyek\\^m- > \\*dyak\\^m- > \\*dyak\\^w- > \\*dayk\\^w- > \\*t\u00e1yxwo:N \\\\ \\*taigw\u00f3:n > OE t\u00e1he \\\\ t\u00e1, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA \\*-y- appearing from nowhere in \u2018toe\u2019 when other words for \u2018toe\u2019 and related \u2018ten\u2019 had oddities should be examined for a connection.  That both Gmc. and G. had \\*m > \\*w / \\*u in words for \u2018finger / toe\u2019 seems related.  Maybe y-m > y-w was more common, or these derivatives are old from \\*dyek\\^m-on- with m-n > wn, etc., then \\*n > l in Greek (which shows many alternations of r / l / n ).  Who can say?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs more evidence, there is no regular rule explaining \\*d > j in Skt. from assimilation at a distance (despite attempts by Lubotsky):\n\n\\*dH3g\\^hmo- \u2018evil/bad/crooked\u2019 > Skt. jihm\u00e1-, G. dokhm\u00f3s\n\n\\*dyu- > Skt. dy\u00fat- \u2018shining\u2019, jy\u00f3tis- \u2018light/brightness\u2019\n\n\\*dng\\^hu()- > Skt. jihv\u0101\u0301 \u2018tongue\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLubotsky mentioned \u201csecondary i\u201d for the cause.  This is not a case of \\*di- > ji-, or more specific, otherwise it would be separate from that seen in Iranian \\*zizva: \u2018tongue\u2019.  Since later Indic \\*H > \\*\u01dd > i existed, it only looks like this is part of the reason.  Instead, it is \\*dy- that optionally became \\*jy- (as very clear in \\*dyu- > jy\u00f3tis-) and caused -i- to appear in \u2018tongue\u2019.  Balto-Slavic shows supposed \\*dng\\^hu()- > \\*yng\\^hu()- for no reason.  Doesn\u2019t it make more sense for older \\*dyng\\^hu()- to explain both oddities?  Why would 2 separate branches show palatal changes to supposedly non-palatal \\*d- in the same word?  These roots show other evidence of \\*dy-.  As \\*dyeyw-iyo- > Gaulish diIivion \u2018heavenly?\u2019, Oscan di\u00edvia\u00ed, Latin d\u012bus \u2018radiant/divine?\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to have any other explanation, most IE with y-y > 0-y seems best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChanges:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*(s)neudh- ( > \\*(s)neubh- ) \u2018wet\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*neubh-s > \\*newbh-s > Latin n\u016bbs / n\u016bb\u0113s \u2018cloud\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*newbh-s > \\*navps > \\*na:ps >> Skt. n\u0101\u0301bhas \u2018clouds\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*newbh- > \\*nembh- > L. nimbus \u2018cloud\u2019, MP nam(b) \u2018moist\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*newbh- > \\*nebhw- > \\*neww-? > \\*nem(w)os > OIr nem \u2018sky/heaven\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*newbh- > \\*nwebh- > \\*mwebh- > L. mef\u012btis \u2018poisonous gas from swamp/volcano\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*newbh- > \\*nwebh-H1lo- > G. neph\u00e9l\u0113 \u2018cloud\u2019, \\*nibula- > Dutch nevel \u2018mist\u2019, OSax. ne\u00dfal \u2018fog/darkness\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*newbh- > \\*nwebh-os- > G. n\u00e9phos \u2018cloud\u2019, Skt. n\u00e1bhas- \u2018cloud/fog/mist\u2019, OCS nebo \u2018sky\u2019, H. n\u0113pis \u2018sky/heaven\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*nwebh-os- > \\*nRWebh-os- > \\*dRWebh-os- > \\*debh-os- > Li. debes\u00ecs, Luw. tappas \u2018sky/heaven\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLubotsky, Alexander (1995) Sanskrit h < \\*Dh, Bh\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/428975](https://www.academia.edu/428975)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStrand, Richard (? > 2008) Richard Strand's Nurist\u00e2n Site: Lexicons of K\u00e2mviri, Khowar, and other Hindu-Kush Languages\n\n[https://nuristan.info/lngFrameL.html](https://nuristan.info/lngFrameL.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhalen, Sean (2023) Indo-Iranian Nasal Sonorants (r > n, y > \u00f1, w > m)\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/106688624](https://www.academia.edu/106688624)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhalen, Sean (2024a) Indo-European \\*wet- \u2018Old / Year\u2019 and New Sound Changes (Draft)\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/114578308](https://www.academia.edu/114578308)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhalen, Sean (2024b) Gandharv\u00e1-s & K\u00e9ntauros, V\u00e1ru\u1e47a-s & Ouran\u00f3s\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/115937304](https://www.academia.edu/115937304)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhalen, Sean (2024c) Etymology of Greek pe\u00fak\u0113 \u2018pine\u2019, Linear B pe-ju-ka, \\*pyau\u1e6d\u0107\u012b > Prasun wyots; Indo-European \\*py-\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/114830312](https://www.academia.edu/114830312)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhalen, Sean (2024d) Combining Sound Changes to Find the Etymology of Greek Hek\u00e1t\u0113, Anta\u00eda, \u00c1rtemis, Ath\u0113na\u00ed\u0101 (Draft)\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/115800323](https://www.academia.edu/115800323)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhalen, Sean (2024e) Reclassification of North Picene (Draft)\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/116163380](https://www.academia.edu/116163380)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZoller, Claus Peter (2010) Aspects of the Early History of Romani\n\n[https://journals.uio.no/actaorientalia/article/view/5352](https://journals.uio.no/actaorientalia/article/view/5352)",

        "selftext": "In historical times, Messapic was spoken in southern Italy.  However, there was a tradition that speakers of Messapic came from Crete (Whalen, 2023a).  If this was based on their tradition, or clear similarity to people from Crete observable at the time, this could be true.  Currently, it is seen as close to Albanian.  Though the only contact with Greek, under the Albanian theory, would be with Greek colonists in Italy, after an unknown period in which their only neighbors would be speakers of Italic and Etruscan, there are many, many obviously Greek words in Messapic, that are said to be loans, and very little Italic.

Though G. did not mark the length of letters like A, most languages with length distinctions change diphthongs into long vowels.  This would show eu- was pronounced ev- in dialects early, as late, and \\*vf > v / f (also explaining loss of -u- in \\*davfn\u0101 > Greek d\u00e1phn\u0113 / daukhn\u0101- \u2018laurel\u2019).  This is found in Ms. Daxtassi Vaanetos \u2018Vaanetos, son of Dazet\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Mooklioos, only an origin in a word of at least 4 syllables makes sense, and the match with Greek can\u2019t be ignored.  A sequence of -ioo- representing 3 successive V\u2019s is unlikely (except maybe in Greek); if -li- represented \\*l\\^ (palatalized before \\*e, then \\*ew > \\*\u00f6w), it would make sense of another group:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA palatal \\*t becoming th is known in Ms. (\\*kWe > \\*k\\^e > \\*t\\^e > G. te, \\*t\\^i > Ms. ti / thi \u2018and\u2019); thus, Simona Marchesini (1995) derived Ms. Blatthes < \\*Blatyos, but also did not consider dissimilation of \\*y-y or \\*y > l.  Ms. Blatthes, Cr. B\u00edaththos are cognate, and the missing link is provided by the presence of  the name P Blattius Creticus (found on an offering in the Alps).  Hitchman in \u201cSome Personal Names from Western Crete\u201d shows that Cr. B\u00edaththos and G. Talth\u00fabios (from thal\u00e9th\u014d \u2018bloom/thrive\u2019 and \\*gWiH3wo- \u2018alive\u2019, with loss of \\*H in many compounds) were names alternately passed down to father and son, which made him question if G. bio- gave B\u00edaththos (such names are often related in one out of two elements).  Indeed it did, with \\*y-y or \\*y > l (or \\*y > \\*l\\^ > l as in Arm. \\*yugo-m \u2018yoke\u2019 > luc; \\*ye(:)kWrt \u2018liver\u2019 > leard ):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*gWiH3oto- \u2018life\u2019 > G. b\u00edotos / b\u00edos, \\*biotios > Cr.

If each group shows the same changes, legend says they came from Crete, and these names are found in both places, etc., there is no reason to doubt this any more than any piece of evidence from stories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not just names; all words are Greek, showing few differences from known dialects.  PIE \\*wetes- > G. auto-et\u1e17s \u2018in/of the same year\u2019, Ms. atavetes with au > a, o > a.  This auto- as \u2018same\u2019 is not normal in IE words with \\*wet(os)- of the same meaning, it\u2019s unique to G.  Changes like Ms. \\*o > a are seen in Macedonian, and I will give many more.  PIE \\*bher- \u2018carry\u2019 > G. ph\u00e9r\u014d, Ms. 3pl. subj. beran; G. ph\u00edlos \u2018one\u2019s own/friend/dear/worthy\u2019, Ms. biles, gen. bilihi, \u2018son\u2019, show ph > b like Mac.  Changes of e > i like G. dia. (\\*kWetwor- \u20184\u2019 > Hom. p\u00edsures / Les. p\u00e9s(s)ures ), and since \\*-yo > -i matches that seen in G. s\u00edlphion \u2018silphium / laser(wort)\u2019, \\*sirphio- > \\*sirphi- > Latin sirpe; PIE \\*gWlhinyo-s > \\*koleniyo-s > Cr. \\*koleni-s > NG Cr. kol\u00e9n\u0113s \u2018oak-grove\u2019.  Change of ph > p by r in sirpe matches G. Aphrod\u012b\u0301t\u0113 : Ms. Aprodita, probably only when in different syllables (if regular).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow would \\*upo- become hipa- without Greek \\*u- > hu-, Greek \\*u > \u00fc, and dialect Greek \u00fc > i?  None of this appears in Alb., and this is the simplest of all examples.  Why \\*s > h in exactly the environments for G., not Alb.?  Why would Messapia be \u2018between the waters\u2019 (known to be a word for \u2018peninsula\u2019, based on their location), from \\*medhyo- \u2018middle\u2019 when \\*dh > d in Alb.?  This requires \\*dh > \\*th, \\*thy > ss, remaining \\*th > d.  This is the sequence in Mac., not Alb., and there is no way to avoid this.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn G. the\u00f3phoros \u2018possessed by a god / (divinely) inspired\u2019, Ms. t(h)abara- \u2018priest\u2019, they come from PIE \\*dh(e)H1so-, so Alb. would have d-.  Though Mac. changed \\*th > d later, when the V created by vocalization of \\*H1 formed, it was different from \\*e, maybe \\*H1 > \\*E or \\*\u01dd (open or reduced V).  Then, unstressed \\*\u01dd > 0 (or all \\*\u01dd > 0 unless it would create a monosyllable).  Loss of \\*H1 by \\*s ( > \\*h ) might also be responsible.  For \\*H becoming \\*\u01dd that could be deleted, see \\*H1isH2ro- > \\*HihHro- = \\*HihH\u01ddro- > \\*Hih\u01ddro- > G. hier\u00f3s \\\\ hiar\u00f3s \\\\ iar\u00f3s \\\\ \u00eeros \\\\ ros \u2018mighty/supernatural\u2019), with -a- expected in all, not -a- vs. -e- / -0-.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven \\*n disappeared before \\*Ch, showing that it was a fricative, and a devoiced \\*d became t / th (just as G. d\u00e1pt\u0113s \u2018eater / bloodsucker (of gnats)\u2019, Cretan th\u00e1pta \u2018gnat\u2019, more below), which only works if \\*d was \\*\u00f0.  The 3rd sng. -s must be G. -si < -ti, the opt. 3rd pl. -ain is like G. -oint-, which is not an allowed cluster in any IE but Greek.  All this points to a language very similar to Macedonian, in which almost every word was seen in Ionic G., only differing due to sound changes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Ms. kos kraapati argorian \u2018whoever should steal the money\u2019, kraap- would have a long V from a diphthong, \\*au or \\*ai.  This obviously is from \\*kraup-, which matches G. kal\u00fapt\u014d / kr\u00fapt\u014d \u2018cover / hide / conceal\u2019 (with meaning as in kl\u00e9pt\u014d \u2018steal / conceal\u2019).  It shows that r vs. l is part of a sound change, and other IE do not have kl- > kal- or obvious cognates of these forms.  It is pointless to continue looking elsewhere when all matches are in Greek.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf ph > p in loans (Aprodita), why ph > v in (e)ipigrave?  Ms. had native words with -p-.  This suggests it was older, which makes no sense, or that phr > pr but VpV > VvV.  This is impossible due to -p- in hipa-, etc.  Only a stage with -ph- > -f- > -v- (like Arm.) would work, which prevents these from being loans.  Words with VCi > ViCi like \\*-osyo > -aihi; Ms. (e)ipigrave, G. epigr\u00e1ph\u014d; also might show an Arm.-type change.  If ei- / i- is just spelling, the \\*sy > \\*hy > ih resembles G. \\*ny > in, and intermediate \\*-oiho is possible, too.  Even deiva / diva \u2018goddess\u2019 is from \\*thewos < \\*theos < \\*thehos, G. the\u00f3s, with new glide (as in \\*bhiliyos > G. ph\u00edlios \u2018friendly/beloved\u2019, \\*biliwos >> Ms. biliva \u2018beloved (fem)\u2019), with dialect eo > io, among many examples of \\*e > i.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarly loans from Greek to Ms. to Latin are much more extensive than expected if Ms. merely contacted Greek at much the same time as the rest of Italy, and often show alternation of l / r or l / d, both seen in dialects on Crete (Cr. th\u00e1pta \u2018gnat\u2019, Polyrrhenian l\u00e1tta \u2018fly\u2019), and other such changes.  No historical Greeks who came to Italy are specifically known to speak a dialect with l > r.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG. Odusse\u00fas / Olutteus / \u014clix\u0113s, L. Ulix\u0113s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG.

Also k\u0113raph\u00eds \u2018kind of locust\u2019.  That G. bro\u00fbkos / bre\u00fbkos \u2018grasshopper\u2019 is also >> Cr. Bre\u00fbkos shows a tendency in naming.  That a Cretan form like \\*ska:rabos existed and gave L. scarabaeus seems clear.  Knowing that this path existed shows a clear connection among Crete, Greek words in Latin and Ms., and Ms. as from Crete.  These words are likely << \u2018horn\u2019, \\*k\\^(e)rsro- > ON hjarsi \u2018crown (of the head)\u2019, G. k\u00f3rs\u0113 \u2018head / temple\u2019, showing these are native G. words.  A similar path in TB karse \u2018deer?\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor t\u00fbkon / s\u00fbkon > \\*\u03b8\u00fc:kos > L f\u012bcus (Italic change of \\*\u03b8 > f), palatal \\*t also becoming th is known in Ms. (\\*kWe > \\*t\\^i > ti / thi \u2018and\u2019; Blatthes, Blattius); \\*tu > \\*t\\^\u00fc is needed in dia. with s\u00fbkon, so putting these together leaves Ms as the only choice.  This \u00fc > i is needed for others (m\u016b\u0301rioi > m\u012blia).  Why would Ms. have borrowed a supposedly foreign Greek word, changed it by its own standard in a few years, then been the source of another loan into Latin when Greeks presumably were plentiful in the area?  The only idea that makes sense is that \\*th\u00fc:kos is a native Ms. word, that they loaned into Latin in the centuries before any (other) Greeks arrived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor \\*l\u00e1tl\u014dn > L. latr\u014d, compare the names \\*L\u00e1tl\u014dn > Phoca. L\u00e1tr\u014dn, Phoc. Lat\u014dn\u00f3s, Cr. L\u00e1t\u014ds.  Since Phoc. L\u00e1tropos also exists, these are clearly related (Phoc. Greeks founded Phocaea; these rare names being seen there makes 2 separate derivatives very unlikely).  If native L., it would have \\*l-l > l-r after \\*tl > kl (\\*lutlom > lucrum).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would ph\u00e1laina > balaena?  Standard theory says a Mac. form was responsible, but Italians weren\u2019t in contact with Macedonians, but Messapians.  Mac. \\*o > a in l\u00f3gkh\u0113 > lancea is equally unlikely, but Ms. had \\*o > a (not PIE \\*o > a, but G. \\*o > a ).  \u014clix\u0113s, L. Ulix\u0113s shows \u014d > u like Ms. Platoor / Platur.  If el\u00e9ph\u0101s > \\*eref\u014ds > \\*erebor > L. ebur, it would show a > o by P, like G. abl\u00e1beia : Cr. ablopia; likely also ph\u1e53g\u014d \u2018roast/toast/parch\u2019 < \\*be\\\\a(H2)g- (OE bacan, E. bake, Slavic \\*bagati \u2018ignite\u2019, Ph. bek\u00f3s \\\\ b\u00e9kos \u2018bread\u2019, Arm. boke\u0142 \u2018kind of round soft bread\u2019).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would Messapians name their winds with a foreign Greek name?  G. at\u0101bur\u012b\u0301t\u0113s is likely from \\*art\u0101 \\*burg- \u2018bake bread\u2019, G. phr\u016b\u0301g\u014d \u2018roast/toast/parch\u2019, Latin fr\u012bg- \u2018roast\u2019, Skt. bhrajj-.  Since the ultimate source of these words and the path it took to G. are unknown, the loss of -g- likely comes from \\*rug > \\*urg, with \\*rg > \\*r like \\*rd > r in Crete (G. kr\u00e1d\u0113 \u2018fig-tree\u2019, \\*k\u00e1rda > Cr. k\u00e1ra; G. p\u00e9rdix \u2018partridge\u2019, Cr. p\u1e17rix), since some g > d there (hagn\u00f3s, Cr. adn\u00f3s \u2018holy\u2019).  Not all these need have passed through Ms. to L., but most certainly are not standard G., and no makeup of the G. colonists to Italy seems to explain it.  Most of these have been seen as Ms. (intermediary) before.  Almost all these required changes are seen in Crete.  We have much less ability now to determine where the Messapians lived immediately before coming to Italy than they did then.  Why attempt to get the better of the ancients when there is no way to prove that they did not come from Crete?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe many, many Cretan names in Task- and Dask-, like C. T\u00e1skos, T\u00e1skus, T\u00e1skis, Task\u00e1das, Task\u00fadas, Taski\u00e1das, Dassk\u00e1das, Dask\u00e1das, Taskainn\u00e1das, Taskann\u00e1das, Taskom\u00e9n\u0113s are matched by many, many names in Daz- for Messapic, like M. Dazimas / Dazomas, Dazos, Dazet, gen. dazohonnihi, dazinnihi, dastidda.  These would likely be from G. Ktasadas, Kt\u0113si\u00e1d\u0113s, etc.  These are from kt\u1e17sios \u2018belonging to (one\u2019s) property/home\u2019, kt\u00e1omai \u2018get / obtain\u2019.  Most attested names from G. dialects that changed \\*a: > \\*e:, but many named Ktasadas in Lycia (the sons of Kt\u0113sikl\u00eas, Kallikr\u00e1t\u0113s, Diog\u00e9n\u0113s, etc., so certainly Greek).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Cr., T- vs. D- must come from optional kt- / gd- (G. (k)t\u00fapos / (g)do\u00fbpos \u2018crash / din /knocking / thud\u2019), then Kt\u0113si\u00e1d\u0113s : \\*Kta:si\u00e1da:s > Taski\u00e1das.  Ms. would then show only the voiced variants, with \\*Dags- > \\*Dagz- > Daz-.

If only 2 words are found on jar, it would be unlikely 1 would be \u2018sacrifice / offering\u2019 and the other a name, unless the name of a god(dess).  I think it would improve this derivation to see u-na-a as \\*uin\u0101C (maybe showing that \\*-\u0101 > \\*-a, or that long V\u2019s were not always spelled out), as in \u2018offering of wine (from this jar for wine)\u2019, which fits the context.  Otherwise, \\*oinawyos > G. Oine\u00fas, Oina\u00eeos, \\*-awyoi contracted > \\*-aai ? (so \u2018to Bacchus\u2019?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs further evidence, see the context of LA libation formula on the ladle TL Za 1 (given in Younger) with U-NA-KA-NA-SI as uin\u0101-kransin from \\*oin\u0101-krantim \u2018mixing/blending (of wine & water)\u2019:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG. k\u00edgkr\u0113mi / ker\u00e1nn\u016bmi \u2018mix / mingle / blend / dilute wine with water\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nk\u00edgkr\u0113mi >> kr\u00easis \u2018mixing/blending (of wine & water)\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nker\u00e1nn\u016bmi >> \\*krantis > kransi-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith each stem (with or without nasal infix) creating its own derivative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnoun/verb endings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-ais : -ois\n\n\\-aihi : -oio < \\*-ohy\u00f6\n\n\\-ain : -ointo\n\n\\-idda : -id\u00ed\u0101\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*-idyos > \\*-idy\u00f6s > \\*-ides before dy > ddy was probably optional:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*gWiH3oto- \u2018life\u2019 > G. b\u00edotos / b\u00edos, \\*biotios > Cr. B\u00edaththos, \\*by- > bl- in P Blattius Creticus, Ms. Blatthes / Blathes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe presence of names ending in -a(m)bos on Crete, like S\u1e17rambos, s\u1e17rambos \u2018kind of dung beetle\u2019, could be seen as the source of words with unknown etymology in -bos.  There are several Greek words of similar meaning ending in -ambos or -umbos:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00edambos \u20182-syllable metrical foot / iambic verse\u2019\n\nthr\u00edambos \u2018hymn to Dionysus / name of D.\u2019\n\nd\u012bth\u00farambos \u2018hymn to D. / name of D. / bombastic speech\u2019\n\n\u00edthumbos \u2018song and dance for followers of D.\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these might originally been names for songs/dances used in festivals and the worship of Dionysus (and thus all likely loanwords).  The association of \u00edambos with 2 and its similarity to thr\u00edambos which could be from \\*tri- \u20183\u2019 makes a connection between d\u012bth\u00farambos and \\*kWetur- \u20184\u2019 seem possible.  Though d\u012bth\u00far- is not immediately obvious as < \\*kWetwor-, G. tetr\u00e1ki \u2018four times\u2019 is the source of Greek tetrak\u00edn\u0113 / thidrak\u00edn\u0113 \u2018lettuce\u2019, and \\*thidwur-aki-k-s ? > \\*thwidraks > thr\u00fadax \\\\ thr\u00eddax \\\\ th\u00eddrax \\\\ thr\u00f3dax.  This shows that \\*thidwur- > thidra- meant \u2018four\u2019 (from the form of the flowers, arranged into groups of 4 petals).  Ms. is known to have changed \\*kWe \u2018and\u2019 > thi, so this fits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey all resemble IE numbers, so in \u00ed- \u20182-syllable\u2026\u2019, thr\u00ed-, d\u012bth\u00far- it seems unlikely to be chance. Some might have been formed like Latin tripudium \u2018kind of religious dance\u2019 from Indo-European numbers:  two-step, three-step, etc. (describing the timing of the rhythm, the number of steps in each section, or any similar feature).  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen these speculations before, but I don\u2019t know the exact source.  If these came from a form of Greek similar to LA it would confirm several sound changes.  Adding in data from Ms., most of these changes are confirmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 \\*dwi- > \\*dwy- > \\*wy- > \\*yy- > \\*iy- > \u00edambos \u20182-syllable metrical foot / iambic verse\u2019 (\\*dwiH2pyugo- >> I\u0101pug\u00eda )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 \\*tri- > \\*thri- > thr\u00edambos (alternation of Chr / Cr likely from \\*R, G. Aphrod\u012b\u0301t\u0113 : Ms. Aprodita, G. s\u00edlphion \u2018silphium / laser(wort)\u2019, \\*sirphio- > \\*sirphi- > Latin sirpe )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 \\*kWetwor- > \\*k\\^idwur- > \\*t\\^iwdur- > \\*thiwdur- > d\u012bth\u00farambos (\\*kWe > ti / thi, \\*-t- > -d-, also met.; maybe dissim. of \\*kwiw- > \\*kwi:- if the stages for \\*kWe > ti / thi were \\*kwe > \\*kw\\^e > \\*k\\^we, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10 \\*dekmt-ulos > \\*dek\u00e3t-ulos > d\u00e1ktulos \u2018finger, toe\u2019 (maybe this is also related to loss of \\*\u01dd from syllabic C (if \\*m > \\*\u01ddm > \\*\u00f5 / \\*\u00e3, etc.), G. the\u00f3phoros\u2019, \\*\u00f0\u01ddho- > \\*\u03b8ha- > Ms. t(h)abara-.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat leaves \u00edthumbos the only problem.  If from PIE \u20185\u2019, it would require a lot of changes.  However, when I saw that the path of change for signs from CH > LA / LB (Ferrara et al.) included\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI \\*28 < CH 008 hand with 5 fingers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince neither \u20185\u2019 nor \u2018hand\u2019 begins with i-, I might have been in trouble if I hadn\u2019t been saying for years that \u00edthumbos was \u20185\u2019 in this sequence.  I considered the fact that some languages lose the old word for \u20185\u2019 and replace it with \u2018hand\u2019 or \u2018all\u2019.  If \u2018five\u2019 was replaced in LA, then there\u2019s a solution.  Since G. has\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*wik\\^wo- > \\*wiswo- > wiswos, Att. \u00edsos \u2018equal/same/even\u2019, Skt. v\u00ed\u015bva-, Av. v\u012bspa- \u2018whole/every/all\u2019 (WI-SI-PE = WISPE \u2018all\u2019 on the Phaistos Disk, Whalen, 2023d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhich was \u2018all\u2019 in other IE, a path \\*wiswo > \\*yithwo > ithu- would work.  Either w-w > y-w or some w > y before front (with dissim. of \\*w-w or the same changes as in \\*wes- > \\*w\\^es- > \\*yes- > G. h\u00e9speros \u2018evening\u2019, L. vesper ).  That an old theory of mine requires i- for \u20185\u2019 in a language that loaned words into G., and the CH for \u2018hand\u2019 has been shown to be the source for I \\*28 by another researcher who had no knowledge of this (or mentioned the consequences for Greek / LA for any sound values it would produce) seems like independent evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough I say \\*wik\\^wo- > \\*wiswo-, most would see this as impossible for an apparent Centum language.  Phrygian has the same optionality.  For opt. K\\^ > T\\^ in G. :\n\n\\*bhak\\^- > G. phak\u00f3s \u2018lentil\u2019, ph\u00e1s\u0113los \u2018bean\u2019, Alb. bath\u00eb \u2018broadbean\u2019\n\n\\*dheH1k(\\^)o- > Skt. dh\u0101k\u00e1- \u2018container\u2019, G. th\u1e17k\u0113 \u2018box/chest/grave/tomb\u2019, th\u0113saur\u00f3s \u2018treasure/store-room/safe/casket/cavern/subterranean dungeon\u2019\n\n\\*g\\^en(H1)os- > L. genus, G. g\u00e9nos, pl. gen\u00e9\u0101, Cr. zenia, Ms. zenaides\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has greater consequences than you might think.  Hitchman noted that these Cretan names varied in their endings, with -os / -us / -is (T\u00e1skos, T\u00e1skus, T\u00e1skis, Ms. Daszes), which matches Linear A names in -e / -u corresponding to LB ones in -o.  He compared Cr. B\u00edaththos to LB qi-ja-to (a shepherd from Knossos), LA qi-ja-du.  For -th- : -d-, see Mac., Cr., above.  Knowing this name is Greek and comes from \\*gWi(H)wo- \u2018alive\u2019 proves that (at least some) Greek names were written in LA.  Ms. biles, gen. bilihi, \u2018son\u2019, show ph > b like Mac.; -es matches LA names in -e corresponding to LB ones in -o, providing every step in the process.  He did not follow it through to this conclusion because he thought these Cretan names were not Greek, and did not attempt to consider the sound changes that would exist if so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say that Messapic is as Greek as Macedonian (take that however you like).  In the interest of parsimony I would say that having a group of Greeks on Crete who speak a very divergent form of Greek makes Chiapello\u2019s claims that LA was Greek very clear.  I have tirelessly worked on finding all implications of this, using known sound changes from Crete to explain why LA was not deciphered until now.  Almost every change in Ms. is seen in LA.  Just as several very odd words, very odd changes, many dialects existed on Crete, I see no reason why one of them could not come to Italy when Minoan society began to crumble.  G. te matches Ms. ti with e > i, as in many LA words, and these changes also include Pa > Po (\\*panto- > \\*ponto- in the LA accounting terms ku-ro \u2018(sub-)total\u2019, po-to-ku-ro \u2018grand total\u2019), o: / u:, o / u (LA has few signs for Co used), th > d (especially on the Phaistos Disk).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease see the obvious equations here.  If you could send this to as many people as you know, mention it to students, friends, anyone, it could help immensely.  Don\u2019t let a mistake continue unchecked for so long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/116877237](https://www.academia.edu/116877237)",

        "title": "Lepontic Inscriptions",
        "selftext": "Lepontic is either a kind of Celtic or very similar to it.  Some Lepontic coins have sege\u03b8u next to a picture of an owl, others with a stag.  This matches OIr seth \u2018stag / hawk\u2019 < \\*segWheti- \u2018hunting\u2019, used of hunting animals or animals hunted.  Since Celtic \\*segWhetiyo-s >> G. Hego\u00fasiai \u2018Celtic hunting dogs\u2019, late L. segusius / segutius / etc. \u2018hunting dog\u2019, \\*segwesios > It. segugio, \\*sebwesios > Sp. sabueso / sabejo, a loan from Celtic or Lepontic seems likely.  The Lep. name Segezos is certainly related.  This means that \\*ty could become sounds represented by \u03b8 or z in Lep.  That these were real sound differences, not just spelling, is shown by other words with various outcomes of \\*ty, such as y ( pruiam = bruyam ).  Below, the same clusters seem to have dialect differences, with the strong possibility that z thus was something like t\u03b8 / d\u00f0 / dz (see zvo\u015boris below for (some?) z being voiced).  Similar outcomes in Greek \\*biwotyo-s > Messapic Blatthes, Cretan B\u00edaththos, P Blattius Creticus; many IE changed palatals > interdentals (OP and Alb. \\*k\\^ > \\*t\\^ > th ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese sometimes merge with \\*-st- which often became \\*-ts- > -s- in other Celtic.  That some \\*-st- were voiced as \\*-dz- seems needed for \\*trisres \u20183 fem.\u2019 > Ga. ti\u0111res.  The Ga. spellings ds / \u00f0\u00f0 /  \u00f0 seem likely to represent dz (or else ts would be used).  Knowing if all these always had the same value, if many were t\u03b8 or the range t\u03b8 / d\u00f0 / dz, etc., is hard to tell.  Thus, the Lep. name Pazros < \\*paH2stor- \u2018feeder / provider / protector / shepherd\u2019, Uvamokozis < \\*upmHo-ghosti-s \u2018greatest host/lord\u2019 might have been pronouned in several ways.  That -zr- existed might show -t\u03b8r- (since many IE avoid tsr / dzr ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA voiced or interdental value for z is required because Lep. \u015b seems to be used for ts .  Many of the words with -\u015b- are of unknown ety., but in one inscr. there is uinom na\u015bom \u2018Naxian wine\u2019 (from Naxos, a place famous for wine).  It is likely that \\*-ksy- could become \u010d, \u0107 or ts, but not that it would also become interdental.  This value likely = ts because of other words with -\u015b (since -ts in IE could come from other sources than palatals ) :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInscription of Prestino\n\n&#x200B;\n\nuvamokozis : pliale\u03b8u : uvltiauiopos : ariuonepos : site\u015b : tetu\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLord Uvamokozis gave (this) standing stone to the U\u2019s and A\u2019s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is certain that site\u015b < \\*seH1dos / \\*seH1des- \u2018(thing) sitting / seat / mound / stone\u2019 (OIr s\u00edde ), since weak -es- could provide -e- in the nom. (though Lep. \\*-o(C) > -e(C) is possible, see below) so why does it end in -\u015b not -s ?  IE neu. nouns in -os- often have -t- not -s- in weak cases, or alternate :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*widwo:s, \\*widwot- \u2018having seen / knowing / wise / witness\u2019 > G. eid\u1e53s, eid\u00f3t-, Go. weitw\u014dds\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*leukos- > Skt. r\u00f3cas-, \\*leukot- > Go. liuha\u00fe, OE l\u00e9oht \u2018light\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe simplest explanation for this is that \\*-t- is older.  Words like \\*leukot- formed nom/acc with \\*-d, creating \\*leukot-t > \\*leukost (with \\*-st > -s in most IE).  Preservation of -ts in Lep. would be important in proving this.  Also in the aor. with 3sg \\*-s-t > -s in Skt., etc., but \\*opes-a:-st > \\*-ts / \\*-ks > SPc ops\u00fat / ops\u00faq \u2018he did/made\u2019 ( st / ts as in Celtic, ts / ks as in G., like \\*\u00f3rn\u012bth-s > \u00f3rn\u012bs \u2018bird\u2019, Dor. \u00f3rn\u012bx ).  That both these \\*-ts are in Italy and the region would show a preservation in one area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince \\*naksyom > na\u015bom shows that a palatalized C could become \u015b, it is best to examine other words with possible palatal origin in mind.  Other words with \u015b / s clearly come from PIE \\*k\\^, but have not been seen because most think Lep. was exactly like other Celtic.  Italic shows languages with satem features also (Whalen, 2024a, b).  In the name Esopnos, older \\*Esponos cognate with Ga. Epona < \\*H1ek\\^won- \u2018(of) a horse\u2019 is the only option.  This \\*k\\^w > \\*c\\^v > \\*(t)sp would resemble Ven. :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVen. ekupeta-, L. eques, gen. equitis \u2018horseman / rider / horse-soldier\u2019 < \\*H1ek\\^wet-s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happened in other IE for \\*kw (see \\*wlkWo- \u2018wolf\u2019 >> Paeonian L\u00fakpeios), so it might show there was intermediate \\*kp in G. changes of Kw > kWkW / pp (\\*H1ek\\^wos > L. equus, G. h\u00edppos, Ion. \u00edkkos \u2018horse\u2019; \\*pel(e)k\\^w- > G. p\u00e9lekkon \u2018ax-handle\u2019).  That similar changes might exist in Ven., but not other Italic again shows areal features.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I\u2019m right, \\*g\\^(h) > \\*d\\^ > \\*z\\^ / \\*dz or similar would be needed.  Thus, zvo\u015boris on a stout bottle must be < \\*g\\^hewd-tri-s \u2018vessel for pouring\u2019, related to L. fundere, Go. giutan \u2018pour\u2019 (without -t-; G. kh\u00fatr\u0101 \u2018earthen pot\u2019, L. f\u016btile \u2018water-vessel used for sacrifices\u2019, Faliscan huticulom \u2018water-vessel/pitcher\u2019).  Making an assumption that no Lep. word could start with z- has led to this not even being seen as one word (Mees, though zvo\u015boris as one word in [https://lexlep.univie.ac.at/wiki/CO%C2%B762\\_Casate](https://lexlep.univie.ac.at/wiki/CO%C2%B762_Casate) ), which can only lead to folly.  This would show dialect differences of \\*tt > \\*st / \\*ts ( > \\*t\u03b8 ) as above.  The Celtic \\*eu > ou would allow :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*g\\^hewd-tri-s\n\n\\*zovttris\n\n\\*zovtsris\n\n\\*zovtsoris\n\n\\*zvotsoris\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther names like A\u015bmina must be from \\*H2ak\\^men- \u2018stone\u2019.  There is no other IE word that could give this, and ignoring the obvious ety. for such names should be avoided.  Assuming you know all the sound changes before all words are etymologized is not in keeping with the principles of historical linguistics.  Since so many names seem very grand-sounding, Lep. I\u015bos < \\*H2ik\\^o-, Skt. \u012b\u015b\u00e1- \u2018owning/possessing / lord\u2019 seems likely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLepontic Inscriptions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOrnavasso vase\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlatumarui sapsutai-pe uinom na\u015bom\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-pe, L. -que < \\*kWe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSapsuta would be an odd name.  Only one IE word fits, \\*sa(H2)pos- > L. sapor \u2018taste\u2019.  Since it seems unlikely a vase of tasty Naxian wine would coincidentally be given to a woman named \u2018tasty\u2019 this might be a word for \u2018taste tester\u2019.  Alternatively, if the range in :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nL. sap\u012bre \u2018have flavor / taste like / know\u2019, sapi\u0113ns \u2018wise / knowing / sensible\u2019, OSax. sebbian \u2018notice\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmeant that \u2018know / recognize / be familiar with / accustomed to\u2019 was old, this could be the word for \u2018wife\u2019 (compare \\*(H)uk- > uxor ).

The change of M- > N- or -m- > -n- (Messambr\u00eda vs. \\*Menesbr\u00eda > Menebr\u00eda ) indicates dissimilation of m-m > n-m or > m-n .

However, the Th. place names Briaro / Br\u00edparo(n), and Breierophara < \\*poro- \u2018pass\u2019 make it likely they\u2019re from \\*wriyaro- with r-r > r-0 in most.  These could be related to some PIE words with \\*wrey-, like OE wr\u00eddan \u2018grow/thrive/flourish\u2019 or OE wr\u00edon \u2018cover\u2019 ( if \u2018enclose\u2019 > \u2018wall(ed) city\u2019 ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat -p- / -ph- / -0- are all seen here shows that Th. had a tendency to change p > \\*f > \\*h (as in Arm., Celtic).  This supports Th. ro- (in long names, Roliste) < \\*pro- (Whalen, 2024c).  Since Th. and Arm. also had C-shifts (dh > d, d > t, etc.), their relation to each other and G. seems clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore in [https://www.academia.edu/116541348](https://www.academia.edu/116541348)",

Not all languages have the primary meaning \u2019tooth\u2019 (\\*pi\u014be > F. pii \u2018thorn / prong / tooth of rake\u2019), so it\u2019s possible it first meant \u2018sharp point(ed object)\u2019.  If so, it would correspond to PIE \\*(s)pi(H)no- (L. sp\u012bna \u2018thorn / spine / backbone\u2019, TA spin-, OHG spinela, etc.).  The optional alternations of \\*nx \\\\ \\*xn > \u014b \\\\ n and \\*Hn \\\\ \\*nH > \\_n \\\\ n might then be related.  The short i vs. long \u012b in sp\u012bna \\\\ spinela and related words (L. sp\u012bca \u2018ear (of grain)\u2019, OIc sp\u00edk \u2018wooden splinter\u2019, sp\u00edkr \u2018nail\u2019, G. pikr\u00f3s \u2018pointed/sharp\u2019) could then all be due to optional HC / CH .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the same as Hamito-Semitic, in which supposed \\*sin- \u2018tooth\u2019 must really be \\*sCiHn- (with C and H of some type) to account for -nn- in Sem. \\*\u0161inn-.  H could have become assimilated in Hn > nn there, but H > pharyngeal in South Cushitic (Iraqw si\u1e25ino ).  Also, some sC- is needed to explain (otherwise inexplicable, if traditional reconstruction were correct) \\*s- > \\*!- in Central Chadic \\*!yan(n)- (Mafa !EnnE ).  There is no reason to think traditional reconstruction of tri- and biconsonantal stems makes sense when it would require changes of category like this to be wholly irregular; many C-clusters could have existed in the past.  This !- could be from \\*sl- but, as in Uralic and many IE, a change of interdental > lateral seems possible.  Thus, \\*sp- > \\*sf- > \\*s\u03b8- > \\*s!- in Central Chadic (likely some or all of this in Proto-Hamito-Semitic too, but there\u2019s no way to tell if all other branches had \\*sC- > \\*s-, etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat IE has sp- where Uralic has p- and Hamito-Semitic s- or !-; Hn vs. n \\\\ \u014b and n \\\\ nn; seems odd enough by itself, but with no regular internal explanation for these alternations in any family, it\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re unrelated.  The semantics in Uralic show that the shift > \u2018tooth\u2019 was relatively recent, and there would be no good explanation for why the same occurred in Hamito-Semitic if their relation stretched back, say, 15,000 years.  Since all elements needed to explain these are found within IE (ie. sp- > s- & p-), and the meaning shifted in both other families, it seems to give support to my idea that these families are really branches of IE.  These apparently shared alternations could not have been retained for many thousands of years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are many other words fitting this pattern.  Many support my reconstruction for other odd features within IE.  For example, if Latin com-, cum, Greek (k)sun-, (k)s\u00fan came from IE \\*tsom / \\*ksom, a change of ks > xs > x > 0 would explain Uralic \\*amta-:\n\n\\*(k)som-doH3- > IIr. \\*sam-da:- > K. \u0161imdi \u2018give\u2019, Skt. sa\u1e43-d\u0101- \u2018present / grant / bestow\u2019; \\*amta- > F. anta-, Sm. vuow\u2019de-\n\nAlso note that Kassite is not normally classified as IE, yet has the same primary meaning for \\*som-doH3- as \u2018give\u2019 that Uralic does.  It would be extremely odd for -md- and -mt- to existe by chance in unrelated languages.  Realistically, \\*ts- > s- vs. \\*ks- > \\*xs- > \\*x- > 0- is needed for this, yet the same in s- vs. ks- in Greek seems like yet another great coincidence.  It also is added evidence that many currently unclassified languages are really closely related IE languages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2018Sun, Day\u2019 and \u2018Shadow\u2019:  Tocharian Oddities Clarified by Other Languages\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  IE \\*sk\\^(e)HyaH- \u2018shadow\u2019\n\n\\*sk\\^(e)HyaH- \u2018shadow\u2019 > TB skiyo, G. ski\u0101\u0301, Alb. hije, Skt. ch\u0101y\u0101\u0301-, Av. a-saya- \u2018 shadowless\u2019\n\nThe change of CHy > C(i)y is supposedly of PIE date, but if Toch. had any regularity in palatalization, it should have become \\*\u015b\u0107iyo.  The simplest explanation is that CHy > Ciy happened after palatalization in Toch., which would require it to be late, even if essentially the same in most IE branches.  If all syllabic H > a, there is no reason that a change of -ay- > -iy- wouldn\u2019t work.  The path CHy > Cay > Ciy would fit all other known changes (maybe only short unstressed a > i before y), which allows all syllabic H > a before C > palatal before front, then -ay- > -iy- of some type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith this analysis of \\*sk\\^HyaH- \u2018shadow\u2019 > \\*skaya: > TB skiyo, it is hard not to notice the very similar word in Uralic:\n\n\\*saja \u2018shadow\u2019 > F. suoja, Ud. saj, etc.\n\nSince this most resembles PToch. \\*sk\\^aya:, a loan from PToch. is one possibility.   A loan seems unlikely to me since it is such a basic word.  A large number of IE loans certainly exist, mostly for tools and culture features, but many seem to go too far.  Even \u2018water\u2019, \u2018lead\u2019, and \u2018dig\u2019 have been assumed as IE loans to avoid any genetic relation in words that look very obviously related (\\*wodo:r : \\*wete, \\*wedh(e\\\\o)- : \\*wet\u00e4-, Skt. khan- : \\*kan-).  A loan from Iranian is assumed here ( [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Iranian/caHy%C3%A1H](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Iranian/caHy%C3%A1H) ).  Against the Iranian loan, I assume that Mikhail Zhivlov, who has analyzed the conditions of a-a > o:-e in Finnish, is correct in \\*saja, not \\*saaja ( [https://www.academia.edu/8196109](https://www.academia.edu/8196109) ), which would specifically have favored Iranian (if Uralic had long V\u2019s, it\u2019s not clear when and how they were lost/changed).  Av. a-saya- \u2018 shadowless\u2019 supposedly lost H in compounds, though this does not seem regular.  If a loan from PToch., it would have to be at the very specific time when \\*sk\\^HyaH- > \\*sk\\^aya: but before any other changes (if sk\\^ > ss\\^ > s within Uralic).  The many similar words in IE and Uralic have either been seen as loans or the result of common descent from a Nostratic, etc., stage.  However, none of the changes needed to connect them require such a stage.  Instead, a stage after the breakup of PIE can account for all Uralic data, often specifically Tocharian.  This includes diagnostic changes like \\*-ur > \\*-ru (\\*po\u010dru \u2018reindeer\u2019), \\*e > \\*\u00ef, \\*\u00ef being influenced by neighboring C\u2019s, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  IE \\*kaH2uni-s \u2018sun/day\u2019\n\nAdams:\n\n\\>\n\nkau\u1e43 (n.\\[[m.sg](https://m.sg).\\]) (a) \u2018sun\u2019; (b) \u2018day\u2019\n\nA ko\u1e43 and B kau\u1e43 reflect PTch \\*k\u0101un from a putative PIE verbal abstract \\*kauni-\u2026 a derivative of \\*kehAu- \u2018burn\u2019 \\[ie \\*keH2u-; Sean Whalen\\] \\[: Greek\u2026 ka\u00fbma \u2018burning heat (of the sun)\u2026 The nom. sg. \\*kaunis, nom. pl. \\*kauneyes, and acc. pl. \\*kaunins would give kau\u1e43, kau\u00f1i, and kau(n\u00e4)\u1e43 respectively since a (PIE) \\*-i- was retracted before an \\*-s- and thus caused no palatalization (Adams, 1988c:15). The acc. sg. kau\u1e43 is analogical\u2026 Not with Pedersen (1944:11, also VW:626-7) a borrowing from Turkish g\u00fcn \u2018sun.\u2019 To have given both A ko\u1e43 and B kau\u1e43, the borrowing would have had to have been of PTch in date. So early a date might itself rule out the Turks on geographical grounds. In any case there is no reason \\*g\u00fcn would have given anything but PTch \\*\\*kin or \\*\\*kun. Winter's suggestion of a borrowing in the opposite direction is no more plausible.\n\n\\>\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs IE \\*kaH2uni-s > \\*kauni > TB kau\u1e43 \u2018sun/day\u2019, pl. \\*kau\u00f1ey-es > kau\u00f1i, related to Turkic \\*k\u00fcn(e\u0161) \\\\ \\*ku\u00f1a\u0161 (Uighur k\u00fcn \u2018sun/day\u2019, Dolgan ku\u0144\u0101s \u2018heat\u2019, Turkish g\u00fcne\u0161 \u2018sun\u2019, dia. guya\u0161, etc.)?  Well, both show -n- vs. -\u00f1-, \\*-V\u0161 vs. 0 (in nom. vs. other cases for TB).  Adams explained non-palatalization in the nom. \\*kaH2uni-s as a specific change to \\*-is(-) (see below), as in \\*wi(H)so- \u2018poison\u2019 > \\*w\u00e4s\u00f6 > TA w\u00e4s, TB wase, Skt. vi\u1e63\u00e1-, G. \u012b\u00f3s vs. ? > \\*w\\^\u00e4s\u0101 > TA w\u00e4s \u2018gold\u2019, TB yasa.  If \\*-is > \\*-i\u1e63 > \\*-i\u0161 was the cause of non-palatalization (see other following retro. C\u2019s changing V\u2019s that thus didn\u2019t cause palatalization:  \\*gWerH2won- \u2018heavy stone\u2019 > \\*gWerRwon- > \\*gWe.r.won- > TA k\u00e4rwa\u00f1-, TB k\u00e4rwe\u00f1e \u2018stone\u2019; \\*gWerH2o- \u2018praised / praiseworthy\u2019 > Li. geras \u2018good\u2019, \\*gWerRo- > \\*gWe.r.o- > TA k\u00e4r, TB kare), then the presence of -V\u0161 vs. -0 in Turkic would be explained by Toch. changes alone.  Since these changes are clearly of IE origin in TB and seen within the paradigm (instead of unexplained variants), the TB word seems clearly native.  Why would a Toch. word for \u2018sun\u2019 ever be loaned into Turkic, let alone 2 variants (at least) based on nom. vs. acc.?  I see no reasonable answer, and this is not the only IE word in Turkic that doesn\u2019t seem like a loan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the variants with separate V-harmony (seen in several Turkic words, most certainly native), different cases could again account for things:  \\*kauni vs. \\*kau\u00f1ey-.  If \\*au-i > \\*a\u00fc-i it would explain optional fronting by umlaut as the result of nom./acc. with \\*-iC (vs. gen., pl., etc.), then \\*a\u00fc > \\*\u00e4\u00fc > \\*\u00fc, etc.  A nom. \\*kauni-s > \\*k\u00fcne\u0161, acc. \\*kau\u00f1i-m > \\*k\u00fc\u00f1, pl. \\*kau\u00f1ey- > \\*kun\u00ef- > \\*kuna-, then mixes > k\u00fcn, \\*ku\u00f1a\u0161, etc., seems likely.  This could not show so many similarities that exist within Toch. from IE sources if a loan to or from Turkic.  Again, all the TB alternation has a good IE source (\\*-nis > -n but \\*-neyes > -\u00f1i supposedly from \\*-is- not palatalizing).  It also would help in showing that (some) \u0161 > l in l-Turkic (I feel that both \u0161 > l and l\\^ > \u0161 existed in each branch).  Others have seen these connections solely as loans, since they did not believe it was possible that Turkic was IE, or a close relative of TB.  The relation between Uralic and Turkic does not require an ancient stage of Ural-Altaic:  both languages are IE, close relatives of Tocharian.  Obscuring sound changes have prevented clear direct cognates from being detected until now, but from examining these words that show such intricate and specific shared changes, a starting point has been established for future analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  The Search for Gold\n\nIn \\*H2auso- > L. aurum, \\*w\u00e4sa: > TA w\u00e4s \u2018gold\u2019, TB yasa, the changes needed seem to include some \\*y or other front sound to cause \\*u / \\*w > \\*w\\^.  Since there is also \\*H2ausyo- > OPr ausis (many words for metals contained \\*y vs. 0 ), it is likely:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*H2ausyo-H2-\n\n\\*xawsyax\n\n\\*wyasxax\n\n\\*wyasxa:\n\n\\*w\\^asxa:\n\n\\*w\u00e4sa: > TA w\u00e4s, TB yasa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis can not help but remind one of F. vaski \u2018copper\u2019, \\*waskiyo- ? > Arm. oski \u2018gold\u2019; these could be created by a related metathesis :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*xawsyo-\n\n\\*wasxyo-\n\n\\*waskyo-\n\n\\*waskiyo-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis \\*x-w > \\*w-x is probably the oldest, with later Toch. words the ones who had \\*w-y > \\*wy-.  The insights each group provides for the details of the others should not be considered coincidence.",

Since metathesis is known to be responsible for \\*wlkWo- vs. \\*lukWo- (and maybe also to \\*ulkWo-), it seems likely the same is behind \\*wlep- \\\\ \\*welpo- \\\\ \\*lewp-, etc.  Again, if 2 separate groups, why would metathesis of \\*w-l exist in both?  They also share odd suffixes seen in few words (\\*-(e)Hk\\^o-, \\*-erno-).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are actually several oddities within \\*wlkWo- itself, considered an easily reconstructable word.  Alb. v \\\\ dh has no regularity (Alb. dhemje \\\\ vemje, Rum. omid\u0103 \u2018caterpillar\u2019; Bg. vampir >> Alb. dhampir \u2018half-vampire son of male vampire and human woman\u2019).  Both Go. wulfs, L. lupus, show \\*kW > \\*p (not fully regular, even in Gmc.).  TB walkwe would show \\*kW > kw, which is not the common outcome of \\*kW or \\*KW in general (\\*kWo- > kete \u2018to whom\u2019, \\*kWa:ts? > kos \u2018as much as\u2019, \\*kWa:s- > kosi \u2018cough\u2019); knowing if kw or k was regular would require finding the truth behind some disputed etymologies.  The only other word that might show \\*-kWos > -kwe is TB sekwe \u2018pus\u2019, but this also has oddities in IE, such as a \u201cmoving w\u201d in Lt. svakas (vs. Li.  sakai \u2018resin\u2019), maybe \\*-wk- in \\*sowkos > L. s\u016bcus \u2018juice/sap\u2019.  See:\n\n\\*sokWo-? > G. op\u00f3s \u2018juice of plants\u2019, Alb. gjak \u2018blood\u2019, R. sok \u2018juice/sap\u2019, Lt. svakas, TB sekwe \u2018pus\u2019, L. s\u016bcus \u2018juice/sap\u2019\n\nIf the alternation in \\*sokWo- \\\\ \\*sok(w)o- \\\\ \\*s(w)oko- is real, it would be evidence of an older cluster that became either \\*kW or \\*kw in different IE branches.  If this was \\*kp > \\*kw \\\\ \\*kW, it would fill a gap in PIE phonotactics.  An older \\*kp that had multiple outcomes across IE might also be behind L. sapa, sapp\u012bnus (likely loans from other Italic languages), in which the \\*kW vs. p vs. pp seems to point to old \\*kp as much as anything could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the same way, \\*wlkW- vs. \\*wlp- could also be explained by \\*kp (or \\*k\\^p, since Li. vilpi\u0161\u1ef9s, Arm. a\u0142u\u0113s, etc., actually need \\*p-k\\^ even in standard reconstruction).  That this might actually be attested in supposed \\*wlkWo-s from \\*wlkpo-s could be seen in the name of the Paeonian king L\u00fakpeios or L\u00fakkeios (maybe the equivalent of nearby G. Luka\u00eeos).  I have been considering this odd name for months, and feel that its value as evidence for \\*kp > kp \\\\ kk in Paeonian would fit the relation of \u2018wolf\u2019 to \u2018fox\u2019 (in words like \\*wlp-(e)Hk\\^o- > Li. vilpi\u0161\u1ef9s, etc.).  If the original word for all groups was at least as complicated as \\*wl(e)p-(e)Hk\\^o-, the weak stem \\*wlp-Hk\\^o- is obviously a clear candidate for simplification (or \u201ctabooistic distortion\u201d, or whatever you like).  The change of \\*wlpHk\\^o- > \\*wlpk\\^o- itself would be no different than any loss of H between C\u2019s, not all fully understood (possibly optional in many cases).  An odd \\*wlpk\\^o- becoming \\*wlkpo- would hardly be odd, maybe a regular change at this point (no counterexamples).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf \\*wlp-Hk\\^o- > Li. vilpi\u0161\u1ef9s, it would show regular \\*H > i, but not common \\*H > 0 between C\u2019s.  This might be because \\*-lpk\\^- would not be permitted at that time.  A similar optionality in PIE, but within this word instead of among all \\*-CHC-, could have existed.  The full grade containing \\*-eH- might also have influenced the retention of \\*-H- when it would be expected to be lost (to retain the paradigm, or between obviously related derivatives).  Since Skt. lop\u0101\u015b\u00e1- \\\\ lop\u0101ka- (and similar IIr. words that show K vs. K\\^ (Ni. liva\u0161a, Kt. \u0159av\u00e9ki (and \\*k\\^ > \u0161 is not regular; tsu\\~ \u2018dog\u2019; Skt. k\u00e9\u015ba- \u2018hair on head\u2019, Ni. ke\\~ts \u2018animal hair\u2019; which might show \\*xk\\^))) show \\*k vs. \\*k\\^ this might all be explained anyway by this \\*H being \\*x\\^, with optional assimilation of \\*k > \\*k\\^ in \\*-ex\\^ko- (or any similar type of cluster).  This would remove the need for \\*pk\\^ > \\*kp, allowing simple metathesis after \\*H > 0 between C\u2019s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther oddities might be explained by known changes.  Since all variants \\*wlep- \\\\ \\*welp- \\\\ \\*lewp- appear, why not also \\*lwep- > \\*lop-?  No words beginning with \\*lw-, \\*rw-, \\*my-, etc., are considered to exist, wouldn\u2019t some of these need to exist (in compounds, at least)?  They would have to change in some way in IE branches, and having words for \u2018fox\u2019 with \\*wl- and \\*lw- makes more sense in the context of many cases of metathesis than unexplained loss of \\*w- alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis complex original form might be needed within each group of cognates anyway.  The odd set of Li. l\u00e3p\u0117, Lt. lapsa, OCS lis\u016d, can not come from any known proto-form.  However, if from \\*lopHk\\^o-, a change like \\*lopHk\\^o- > \\*lopsk\\^o- \\\\ \\*lopk\\^so- might fit all data.  The loss of -s- in l\u00e3p\u0117 vs. lapsa would be inexplicable if from original \\*-ps-; if from \\*-psk- \\\\ \\*-pks-, a change \\*s > 0 between certain consonants, then \\*pk > p, doesn\u2019t seem to add more complexities to the above theory.  For \\*leiso- or similar, if \\*lopk\\^so- underwent a change like \\*lopk\\^so- > \\*lok\\^k\\^so- > \\*loyk\\^so- after older \\*oy > \\*ay (or similar), new \\*oy > \\*ey would explain the odd \\*-i-.  This might also fit Irish los \u2018fox\u2019 (if not more directly related to \\*luk\\^(s)u-, etc., \u2018lynx\u2019).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince Li. vilpi\u0161\u1ef9s \u2018wildcat\u2019, L. vulp\u0113s \u2018fox\u2019 show that small canines and felines could have the same names, why wouldn\u2019t the above allow the VERY similar \\*luk\\^(s)u- \u2018lynx\u2019 to be from the same source?  This would explain the presence of \\*-s- vs. \\*-0- (even in close cognates, like Li. l\u00e3p\u0117, Lt. lapsa; OHG luhs, OSw l\u00f3) in both groups to have the same explanation.  Compare:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*luk\\^nun- > pl. lusanunk\u2018, s. \\*lusann > EAr. lusan \u2018lynx\u2019, \u0141araba\u0142 l\u00fcsemn\u01dd \u2018marten\u2019\n\n\\*luk\\^n- > \\*lunk\\^- > Li. lun\u0161is, G. l\u00fagx\n\n\\*luk\\^(s)u- > OHG luhs, OSw l\u00f3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf all from \\*wlpHk\\^o- (or \\*wlpx\\^ko-), the changes could be as above, with some having suffix \\*-no- like \\*wlepano-, etc.:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*wlpHk\\^o- > \\*wlp(s)k\\^o- > \\*luk\\^(s)po- > \\*luk\\^(s)wo-\n\n\\*wlpHk\\^-(e)no- > \\*luk\\^(s)weno- \\\\ \\*luk\\^(s)uno-\n\netc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Irish los \u2018fox\u2019 is indeed from \\*luk\\^so-, it would be another link uniting these groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/113713478/Indo\\_European\\_Words\\_for\\_Wolf\\_Fox\\_Draft\\_](https://www.academia.edu/113713478/Indo_European_Words_for_Wolf_Fox_Draft_)",

        "title": "Porverbs in your language - lets see the difference",
        "selftext": " Guys, tell me how below proverbs sound in your language and explain how they are translated literally. I think the differences based on culture will be funny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **1. Many hands make light work**\n\nWhen many people work together to accomplish a difficult task, it doesn\u2019t seem so difficult. That is the general meaning of this English proverb. In other words, if people work together, the work is easier and is completed more quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Strike while the iron is hot**\n\nThis proverb means that you should take advantage of a favorable situation before it changes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Honesty is the best policy**\n\nIt is best to always be honest and tell the truth. By doing so, you will win the trust and respect of others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence**\n\nOther people\u2019s lives always seem better, happier, and more successful than yours, even if your life is going well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover**\n\nDon\u2019t form an opinion or make a judgment about someone or something based on its outward appearance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. An apple a day keeps the doctor away**\n\nSince apples are rich in vitamin C \u2013 which is vital to our health \u2013 this proverb means that proper nutrition contributes to good health and fewer visits to the doctor. In this English proverb, apples are a symbol of healthy foods and proper nutrition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. Better late than never**\n\nIt is better to do something late than not do it at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you**\n\nDon\u2019t treat badly the person or people on whom you depend on, or who take care of you in some way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day**\n\nTime is needed to do great or important things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. Actions speak louder than words**\n\nA person\u2019s true character can be seen by what he does, not by what he says. A person can talk as much as he wants, but he may not actually do anything to back up his words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. It\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk**\n\nThis funny English proverb means you shouldn\u2019t waste time crying or complaining about something bad that has happened that cannot be changed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12. Still waters run deep**\n\nThis is said about a person who tends to be quiet and does not say much. Such a person often has a \u201cdeep,\u201d interesting personality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13. Curiosity killed the cat**\n\nYou could be harmed by being too curious about or too interested in something that doesn\u2019t concern you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**14. My hands are tied**\n\nThis saying is not to be taken literally. It has a different meaning. It means that a person is unable to change things or render help in a given situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**15. Out of sight, out of mind**\n\nWhen you don\u2019t see or hear about something, you tend to forget about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**16. Easy come, easy go**\n\nThis English proverb means that money is easily earned and just as easily spent or lost (on gambling, for example).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**17. You can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs**\n\nIt is impossible to do something good or accomplish an important task without encountering some problems or making some sacrifices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**18. The forbidden fruit is always the sweetest**\n\nThings that are prohibited seem very attractive or desirable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**19. If you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours**\n\nIf you do something to help me, I will do something to help you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**20. It\u2019s the tip of the iceberg**\n\nAs everyone knows, only a small part of an iceberg is visible above the water. The rest is underwater.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis English proverb is used to describe a situation when we are in the process of trying to do something, and we encounter a difficulty or problem in connection with it. The saying means that the present problem is not the most difficult part of the entire process; many more \u2013 and probably more difficult \u2013 problems lie ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**21. Learn to walk before you run**\n\nLearn basic skills before you attempt to do something more difficult. For example, don\u2019t start to learn English with difficult subjects such as articles or gerunds. Start with easier material, slowly increase your knowledge, and gradually work toward studying more difficult topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**22. First things first**\n\nThe most important things should be done before everything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**23. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew**\n\nDon\u2019t take on more work or responsibility than you can handle at one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**24. It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry**\n\nBe careful and exercise caution \u2013 even if it seems unnecessary and it takes longer to complete something \u2013 and you will avoid potential problems that could arise later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**25. The early bird catches the worm**\n\nIf you arrive early or do something before other people do it, you have a greater chance of succeeding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**26. Don\u2019t make a mountain out of an anthill (or molehill)**\n\nDon\u2019t make a minor problem or difficulty into a major one; don\u2019t exaggerate the significance of a small problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**27. Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way**\n\nIf your desire to accomplish something is strong enough, you will find a way to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**28. Always put your best foot forward**\n\nThe meaning of this English proverb is that you should always try your best to make a good impression on others; show your best traits and qualities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**29. The squeaky wheel gets the grease**\n\nThe person who complains the most or is most vocal about something that he needs is usually the one that receives help or attention\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**30. A rolling stone gathers no moss**\n\nThe last proverb on our list has two meanings: 1) a person who is always moving \u2013 never living in one place very long \u2013 cannot be successful or make a lot of money, and 2) a busy person will not become stagnant but will remain creative and productive.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "In [https://www.academia.edu/82452838](https://www.academia.edu/82452838) their theory that doubling the C denotes stress on the following V makes sense.  I know it would fit other systems of Elamite (see below), and it\u2019s likely some doubled V\u2019s in other scripts indicated the same.  I doubt it had any effect on the C due to stress (as they theorize), it was purely done for emphasis.  I do not think it shows that stress was regular on the 2nd syllable of a word.  There would be absolutely no need to indicate this if so (except in compounds, etc.).  It makes sense that when the stress was on the 1st syllable of a word, no emphasis was shown.  Compare Hittite, which does not add CV- but does for -CV-CV-, etc.  The many uses for it in proper names are probably because many were compounds.  Sometimes they just didn\u2019t show stress at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis allows an interpretation of other words in any El. script using the same system:  El. s\\^\u00e1-ap-pan-na \u2018grape\u2019 simply was \u0161apn\u00e1.  If stress changed the C in some way, it would not be likely to affect both C\u2019s in a cluster.  This also looks remarkably like some North Caucasian words.  In Sergei Starostin\u2019s work, he connected NE \u2018wine\u2019 with NW \u2018honey\u2019.  The problem was the C correspondence.  Even within NWC, Ubykh sWan\u00eb\u00b4 \u2018honey\u2019, Ad. tsWaw\u00eb show n : w.  Obviously, if both from \\*-pn-, it would work.  In NEC, he gives a form \\*\u0292\u0301w\\[\u01dd\u0306\\]n\u0294i, but \\*-pn- would work just as well here (he has none with \\*pn, \\*mn, etc., so as long as they act like other \\*Cn but not plain \\*n it works).  This would account for all alternations, and I remind you that n : w is seen within NWC, so this or a similar cluster is needed even if unrelated to any other group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only does Ubykh sWan\u00eb\u00b4 need to be from \\*tsWapn\u00eb\u00b4, but it has a stressed 2nd syllable, like El. \u0161apn\u00e1.  This would be a great help in proving Starostin\u2019s work connecting NWC and NEC.  Going forward, many words could be checked against Elamite (and other languages) for outside evidence that these relations were real, the nature of the \\*C(C) for both, etc.  A form like \\*dzYCopn\u00ed\u2019o might account for all groups (since \\*w would not be needed to cause rounding, but the V).  Starostin did not think these were close relatives, so more work might need to be done on internal reconstruction (more with \\*Pn, knowing that \\*Co > \\*:Wo was possible, etc.).  Since NC is so complex in C\u2019s, and El. is so plain, some work might need to be done on interpretation (El. a(C)- might be used for \\*ha-, \\*?a-, etc.).  Some of this might have been done (if evidence of Cu vs. Co in [https://www.academia.edu/82452838](https://www.academia.edu/82452838) is right, etc.).  Since \u2018wine\u2019 might be a loan, I looked at a Swadesh list for words of complex shape:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEl. sukma \u2018dust\u2019 : \\*\u0161\\_a\u03c7wA (Chiragh \u0161:a\u03c7:\u02b7a, Ubykh \u0161\u03c7\u02b7a \u2018powder\u2019, etc.), maybe \\*\u0161CaXwo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso note the m : w.

Xwin \u2018mountain\u2019)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis would mean that Hur. f\u0101van\u00eb was not reduplicated, but showed \\*mn > \\*vn > vVn.  That he did not see El. -mn- here, yet it works so well, shows the truth of my idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithout getting into the relatives of NC too much, others could include El. ha(h)p- \u2018listen\u2019, Ur. ha\u0161-u- \u2018hear/listen/obey\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEl. ru-h \\\\ ru-\u00fa \u2018man\u2019 : \\*H\u012dr\u1e33w\u0114 (maybe \\*xirkhwE \\\\ \\*xwirkhE with \\*wV > u as above (zul))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEl. bali \u2018man\u2019 : \\*l\u012dw\u0141\u0114 / \\*\u0141\u012dwlV\u0306 (maybe > Proto-El. \\*lwEli > \\*blali or similar, too much metathesis in NC to be sure).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing through a Swadesh list for the first few entries and finding so many matches is not likely if not related.  That \u2018water\u2019 : \u2018sea\u2019 and \u2018sea\u2019 : \u2018water\u2019 look anything alike should show this is related to meaning, not just a game of picking a few matches.  With my cautions in mind, I hope to contribute to making a better reconstruction of NC and seeing if more matches with Elamite can be found.  It\u2019s likely work on understanding El. scripts will provide more data (if some C and V can be precisely determined, etc.).  Once more clarity exists in both, finding more evidence of their relation should follow.  Keep in mind the long gap between attestations, how long ago some of these languages might have diverged, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=\\\\data\\\\cauc\\\\caucet&root=config&morpho=0](https://starlingdb.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=\\data\\cauc\\caucet&root=config&morpho=0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

In [https://www.academia.edu/104507618](https://www.academia.edu/104507618) some slim evidence of a relation to Saka exists, and I think this can be expanded on.  Not only inscriptions, but the names of kings and tribes can be used to find sound changes common to related branches of Iranian.  All these bits of evidence point in the same direction:  Kings had the same names as gods, show changes seen in the west, and do match other IIr. changes (some given by me in previous theories).  Tocharians have loans from both archaic Iranian and something close to attested Khotanese (which is Sakan); several of these loans match Kushan evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn \u201cA Partial Decipherment of the Unknown Kushan Script\u201d , they mention Nicholas Sims-Williams seeing Kani\u0161ka & his son Huvi\u0161ka as being named for their grandfather or great-grandfather (or father in 3 cases, maybe, since it\u2019s repetitive), by diminutive formation.  This is also shown by the line:  Kozoulou Kadfizou, V\u0113mo Taktoo, V\u0113mo Kadphis\u0113s, Kani\u0161ka, Huvi\u0161ka, Vasudeva & Ka\u1e47ika, Kani\u0161ka II, Baz\u0113\u0161ko \\\\ Vasi\u0161ka, Kani\u0161ka III, Vasudeva II.  Most of these are named from their grandfather; the exception of great-grandfather or father might come from 2 succeeding V\u0113mo\u2019s (assuming a man named V\u0113mo with a father named V\u0113mo would not name his son V\u0113mo, creating what would then become a non-alternating V\u0113mo I > infinity (avoided previously by using the 2nd vs. 1st name when available)), etc.  It also might just show that the oldest was not necessarily the one to receive it (as for Vasudeva & Ka\u1e47ika, with Ka\u1e47ika named for Kani\u0161ka but not becoming king (unless these are 2 names for the same person, as Vasudeva is presumably not Kushan, and he might have taken a(n appropriate, if I\u2019m right below) equivalent Indian name).  The older strategy might have broken down later, since double- and triple-diminutives weren\u2019t possible, we get Kani\u0161ka III, etc.  The basis of this tradition is likely in other IE, such as Greek (son named for their grandfather).  I also see a parallel in Slavic:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Indic A\u015bvins were nameless and undifferentiated in Vedic songs of praise, but this might not be true if standard theory is wrong.  The pair Y\u00e1du- & Turv\u00e1\u015ba- / Turv\u00e1- (ancestor of the \u0100rya- people) are very similar to the A\u015bvins.  Since Turv\u00e1\u015ba- / Turv\u00e1- implies his name came from \u2018swift\u2019 and \u2018swift horse\u2019 (with v-v > v-0 in \\*Turv\u00e1\u015bva- > Turv\u00e1\u015ba-), a nearly certain connection exists.  In the same way, K\u1e5b\u015b\u0101\u015bva- might be \u2018\\*black horse / dark horse / (night) speckled horse\u2019 (the mortal brother of the A\u00e7vins who pulled the chariot of the moon (and/or the sun at night, when it was hidden or passing over the dome of sky or below the ocean)), Av.

Skt. Tukh\u0101ra- \\\\ Tu\u1e25kh\u0101ra- \\\\ Tukkh\u0101ra- \\\\ Tu\u1e63\u0101ra- referred to some group (original unknown) that likely included the Kushans and Tocharians.

Since Iranian often has complex C-clusters, a source from there or its close relatives makes sense, (also considering what we know about the Kushans now).

Alexis Manaster Ramer attempted to show the existence of some in many papers (below).  Seeing that no progress has been made in over 20 years, with linguists often ignoring simple evidence or going backwards, I felt it was best for me to add my insights.  I know it is difficult to understand UA phonology (sometimes it seems like you can only find the truth if you reconstruct backwards and fowards at the same time), but some kind of progress is needed.  For cognates that show k- vs. n-, is it too much to ask to reconstruct \\*kn- for both, even as a stopgap measure, instead of \\*k- \\\\ \\*n- as if no cluster could give both?  If any progress is made, it is easier to look for words with \\*kn- and replace them rather than see if any \\*k- are related to \\*n- and later put them together.  Some clusters reappear later due to compounds, etc., with different outcomes.  If no language is indicated for the cluster, it is in PUA (all after the first 3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nN. \\*p? > p\n\nSince \\*p > 0 is regular, words that sometimes show \\*p > p need an explanation.  In \\*pa?wi, \\*-pa?an \u2018water\u2019 (Gj. pa\u2019wi, etc.) the \u201cglottal stop hop\u201d could move \\*? to any previous syllabe and create words with \\*pa?- > \\*p?a-.  \\*p > 0 vs. \\*p? > p would then explain 0- vs. p- in words for \u2018water\u2019 (loans from other UA are not likely for so basic a word).  \\*pa?wi coming from \\*pa?uy is likely from similar metathesis in \\*pa?uy-ya > \\*pay?uya >  \\*pay?wi \u2018carry/fetch water\u2019 > Od. wa\u2019ig, Nv. vaigi (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/14wk9at/to\\_kill\\_and\\_die\\_in\\_ua/](https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/14wk9at/to_kill_and_die_in_ua/) for ev. of \\*ya forming verb stems).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nN. \\*pt > \\*tp > kp\n\nSince N. \u0161okpal-li \u2018sole of the foot\u2019 could be related to \\*tala (Gj. tala \u2018sole of the foot\u2019, Od. tad \u2018foot\u2019), a compound \\*sup\u00ef-tala \u2018clothing + sole of the foot\u2019 could refer to the sole of sandals, etc., with a shift/mix of meanings very common in languages around the world.

This also allows the haplology needed for L\u00f1. and Sr. to take place at the same time, for \\*\u00efwta-ta > \\*\u00efwta (if \\*tw > \\*wt existed in L\u00f1, 2 separate unconnected cases of haplology of different natures would be needed, very unlikely).  L\u00f1. and Sr. are ALSO the 2 languages in which the outcomes of \\*tw most resemble \\*t, so separating them here seems unneeded.

Note that these words are obviously related, but some of the languages here are the same as for \\*kp above, showing that it was old and optional.

A single \\*CsipkaNC for all these words fits (\\*Cs- since not the same as \\*s-; it could reasonably be ps / ks / kWs ).  \\*CsipkaNC \\\\ \\*CsikpaNC was old then both \\*kp > \\*k\u00efp and \\*pk > \\*p\u00efk (for V-assimilation to explain -i- vs. -\u00ef- in some).  If Uto-Aztecan consonant clusters were fairly common, at least a single word with 3 in a row would would be excpected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*ps\n\nThe fairly clear insertion of V in \\*kp > \\*k\u00efp and \\*pk > \\*p\u00efk implies that this in similar clusters could also be behind -\u00ef- appearing from nothing in words with \\*CC.

It is not reasonable for \\*y\u00efp\u00efsya \u2018arrive / come (back)\u2019 and haps\u00ef \u2018overtake/reach/arrive\u2019 to be separated; \\*-ps- vs. \\*-p-s- in 2 words of the same meaning would be a little much.  Optional \\*ps > \\*p\u00efs and V-assimilation explain the rest.  Like the words above, variants are old and both seen within some languages.  For \\*h- vs. \\*y-, see below ( \\*x\\^ ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*yapsya > \\*yap\u00efsya > \\*y\u00efp\u00efsya > Yq. y\u00e9psa, \\*yif\u00efxya > Od. jiwhia- \u2018arrive\u2019, PB divia, NTpn. dyidy\u00ed\u00edvai \\\\ d\u00efid\u00ef\u00ed\u00edvai \u2018come (back)\u2019, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*hapsya > \\*hap\u00efsya > \\*hap\u00efsi > \\*hap\u00efs\u00ef > \\*haps\u00ef \u2018overtake/reach/arrive\u2019 > T\u00fc. apsV-, Yq. h\u00e1se, Gj. asi-, N. ahsi, Od. aha\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*sp\n\n\\*paspuul \u2018sweat\u2019 > Od. \\*pasul > wahul-, STpn. voor \u2018sweaty\u2019, pl. vapor\n\nFor a \\*CC that either becomes p or merges with \\*s, \\*sp is the obvious choice (since \\*ps is taken).  Most UA had all \\*sp > \\*s; normal \\*p > v in Tpn. but it was prevented in \\*sp ( > -p- in vapor).  The double outcomes likely show \\*sp > \\*pp before a stressed V, \\*sp > \\*s elsewhere:  \\*p\u00e1spuul, pl. \\*pasp\u00faul (from \\*-0 vs. pl. \\*-V in Proto-Tpn.?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*ksp\n\nSince both \\*ps and \\*sp are taken, the cluster in \u2018teardrop\u2019 that Alexis Manaster Ramer had trouble with over the years (latest in [https://www.academia.edu/38601519](https://www.academia.edu/38601519) pg. 253 ) must be something else.  Since it became \\*ks or \\*ps in some, \\*ksp seems best.  Since I also see \\*x that became \\*k or 0 (below), \\*xsp works as well.  There is no optional suffix \\*-wa-, since this w is just the outcome of \\*p in some.  Since some UA show 3 sounds, a \\*CCC is needed (Cll. \\*ok\u1e63wai with \\*k\u1e63w > k\u1e63 / \\*kw > pw ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*okspah\u00ef \u2018teardrop\u2019 > \\*opksai > T\u00fc. opsi-\n\n\\*opk\u1e63ai > \\*op\u1e63i > Ktn. op\u0161i-\u010d , Sr. -\u00f6\u1e63p\n\n\\*opk\u1e63ai > \\*ok\u1e63wai > Cll. ok\u1e63a-m \\\\ \\*okwa-m > opwa-m\n\n\\*okspah\u00ef > \\*oxwa?\u00ef > \\*o?x\u00efwa > Gj. o\u2019ke-wa (metathesis)\n\n\\*oxwa?\u00ef > \\*oxa?\u00efw > Od. oo\u2019og (met., V-assimilation)\n\n\\*okspai > \\*okpi > Eu. ope-t\n\n&#x200B;\n\nto be continued",

Alexis Manaster Ramer attempted to support some theoretical clusters based on dual outcomes from metathesis in [https://www.academia.edu/38518135/\\_1993\\_Blood\\_Tears\\_and\\_Murder\\_The\\_Evidence\\_for\\_Proto\\_Uto\\_Aztecan\\_Final\\_Consonants](https://www.academia.edu/38518135/_1993_Blood_Tears_and_Murder_The_Evidence_for_Proto_Uto_Aztecan_Final_Consonants).  The specific evidence he gives does need some explanation, but his \\*m\u00efkka? vs. \\*m\u00ef??ak \u2018kill\u2019 is a unlikely, requiring a switch of position and gemination for C\u2019s at the same time.  This type of thing is seen in other languages, but primarily known from games played by children (similar to Pig Latin).  Theoretically, it is possible in the deep structure, which would involve 2 C\u2019s, one doubly linked, like BBAC > CCAB.  It seems needed for 2 groups in UA, one requiring \\*kk and the other \\*??, however, I feel there is little motivation for a word like \\*m\u00efkka? to undergo metathesis.  If there were no geminate ?? at the time, it would be even less likely.  It works in theory but seems to need some extra stages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn [https://www.academia.edu/9349216/To\\_Kill\\_and\\_To\\_Die\\_and\\_Other\\_Suppletive\\_Verbs\\_in\\_Uto\\_Aztecan](https://www.academia.edu/9349216/To_Kill_and_To_Die_and_Other_Suppletive_Verbs_in_Uto_Aztecan) Jason D. Haugen and Michael Everdell see a causative suffix \\*ya in another suppletive verb for \u2018kill\u2019, \\*ko-ya > Hp. q\u00f6ya, etc.  Assuming the same \\*ya is behind  \\*mukki + \\*ya > \\*m\u00efkka? \\\\ \\*m\u00ef??ak would also help solve why many \\*CC but no \\*Cy exist in PUA.  From other data, there also seems to also be a non-causative verb suffix \\*ya of unknown purpose.  Precisely in these words for \u2018die\u2019 vs. \u2018kill\u2019, words for \u2018die\u2019 often have \\*y (\\*t\u00efya, \\*ko\u2019yi, \\*ya\u2019ay ); if the causatives of these verbs was \\*-ya-ya > \\*-yya it would explain why \u2018kill\u2019 showed changes that can\u2019t be explained by standard reconstruction (mostly \\*CVCV, etc.).  It is likely that these were 2 separate suffixes containing \\*y that happened to become similar (or the same, though evidence in other verbs might give clarity), both visible indirectly by causing gemination and causative \\*-ya directly in \\*ko-ya > Hp. q\u00f6ya.  If (originally) different in sound, a causative like \\*-iya that became \\*-ya in some environments (or is indistinguishable with our current knowledge) is one possibility, and I\u2019m sure others exist.  Since \\*m\u00efkka? or \\*m\u00ef??ak \u2018kill\u2019 would certainly be related to \\*mukki \u2018die\u2019 and \\*muku?a \u2018spirit (of a dead person)\u2019 finding an explanation that also covers their derivations is preferable.  Applying this method to each problem in turn:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  \\*m\u00efk- \\\\ \\*muk-\n\nSince rounding by m is likely in \\*s\u00efm\u00ef \u20181\u2019 > \\*sum- in some languages, and other words show even optional \\*im > \\*um > -om- in Tr. komu (below), this seems fairly old and of the type \\*m\u00efk- > \\*muk-.  The opposite, \\*u > \\*\u00ef by \\*m, etc., is much less likely.  There is even evidence for an intermediate \\*m\u00efk- > \\*m\u00fck- > \\*muk- since \\*u caused palatalization of dental in Nahuatl (see below and [https://www.academia.edu/38528399](https://www.academia.edu/38528399) (with the same environment but different details)).  For \\*mukki \u2018die\u2019 and \\*muku?a \u2018spirit (of a dead person)\u2019 the second \\*i > \\*u away from \\*m also supports assimilation \\*m\u00efk\u00ef- > \\*m\u00fck\u00ef- > \\*m\u00fck\u00fc- > \\*muku- (since plain u-i > u-u is not regular, if PUA is reconstructed correctly).  This rounding, though not fully regular, may obey several rules after it occurred:  if \\*m\u00fck\u00ef- > \\*m\u00fck\u00fc- was prohibited before \\*y, \\*m\u00efk\u00ef-ya > \\*m\u00fckki (not > \\*\\*m\u00fckk\u00fc ) would be explained.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  \\*-k- \\\\ \\*-kk-\n\nMany CC but no Cy exist in standard reconstruction of Proto-UA.  Applying the method of considering unexpected forms to reflect sound changes, \\*m\u00efk\u00ef+X > \\*mukki \u2018die\u2019 vs. \\*m\u00efk\u00ef+?a > \\*muku?a \u2018spirit (of a dead person)\u2019  would show that an unknown sound X added to \\*k created \\*kk.  If this was \\*y, with \\*ky > \\*kk, it would explain the absence of \\*Cy and the \\*-k- \\\\ \\*-kk- alternation.  What\u2019s more, it explains other points that can be checked by comparing other verbs showing the same changes.  If \\*m\u00efk\u00ef-ya > \\*mukki it would also explain -i from \\*-\u00efya (maybe by > \\*-y\u00efa > \\*-yi ) and enable us to look for the same source in other verbs with -i.  If they show similar alternations, it would support this analysis, such as \\*kim-ya > \\*kimma \u2018come\u2019.  If this explanation of \\*-i vs. \\*-ya is right, \\*ko\u2019yi \u2018die\u2019 might show that it came from \\*ko\u2019\u00ef-ya and \\*ko\u2019\u00ef-ya-ya > \\*ko\u2019yya > \\*koya > Hp. q\u00f6ya, with the same endings.  Also, if \\*m\u00efk\u00ef-ya formed its causative with the suffix \\*ya it might create \\*yy and explain oddities in \u2018kill\u2019 (below) by an odd geminated glide (perhaps practically only found in causatives of \\*ya-verbs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  \\*kk-? \\\\ \\*??-k\n\n\\*m\u00efk\u00ef-ya \u2018die\u2019 + causative \\*ya > \\*m\u00efkiyaya \u2018kill\u2019 > \\*m\u00efkyya > \\*m\u00efk\u2019ya > \\*m\u00efkk?a \\\\ \\*m\u00efk??a > \\*m\u00efkka? \\\\ \\*m\u00ef??ak\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis allows \\*yy > \\*?y before \\*Cy > \\*CC.  A single C geminated before \\*y, but since 2 different \\*C\u2019s now existed before this \\*y, either one geminated.  Thus, the resulting \\*CCC had a reason to undergo metathesis, to \u201cfix\u201d a prohibited cluster (which itself explains my objections to \\*m\u00efkka? \\\\ \\*m\u00ef??ak ).  To fill in the blank in our knowledge, why would \\*yy > \\*?y at all?  Looking at other UA words, it seems a geminate glide can become a ? in some languages ( \\*taywa > MYq taiwo \u2018east\u2019, \\*tawwa > Yq taa\u2019a \u2018sun\u2019 seems to show an optional change to the also-odd \\*wy ).  If a similar rule existed in PUA, or only for \\*Cyy, all would work.  Such a cluster as \\*Cyy would be expected to change in some kind of simplification anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn total:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*m\u00efk\u00ef-ya \u2018die\u2019 > \\*m\u00fck\u00efya (not > \\*\\*m\u00fck\u00fcya ) > \\*m\u00fckyi > \\*m\u00fckki > N. miki (with \\*\u00fc > u as opposed to \\*u > o )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*m\u00efk\u00ef-ya-(i)ya > \\*m\u00efk\u00efyaya \u2018kill\u2019 > \\*m\u00efkyya > \\*m\u00efk\u2019ya > \\*m\u00efkk?a \\\\ \\*m\u00efk??a > \\*m\u00efkka? \\\\ \\*m\u00ef??ak\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*m\u00efkka? \u2018kill\u2019 > T\u00fc. m\u00ef?\u00efga-, L\u00f1. mok-na, SPt. ca-\u014bw\u00efkkaa-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*m\u00ef??ak > Hp. m\u00ef?a \u2018shoot\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne way or another, this paper would not exist without Alexis Manaster Ramer, who has created many papers and many puns no one else would think of (or be willing to show others even if they did).

Since in spelling with the Greek alphabet s was also used for voiced z (not dz or zd), P\u1e17dasos is probably \\*P\u1e17dazos showing optional palatal \\*g\\^ > z (as in \\*bhak\\^- > G. phak\u00f3s \u2018lentil\u2019, ph\u00e1s\u0113los \u2018bean\u2019, see [https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/zxq2up/armenian\\_er%C4%93c\\_elder\\_greek\\_pr%C3%A9sbus\\_old\\_man/](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/zxq2up/armenian_er%C4%93c_elder_greek_pr%C3%A9sbus_old_man/) ), adapted into a dialect without z between vowels. In Greek, \\*r can also disappear optionally (as in phr\u016b\u0301g\u014d, ph\u1e53g\u014d \u2018roast/toast/parch\u2019, see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientGreek/comments/10rhfbm/early\\_loans\\_from\\_greek\\_to\\_latin\\_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientGreek/comments/10rhfbm/early_loans_from_greek_to_latin_explained/) ).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince all these changes are seen in other words, their presence in P\u00f3dargos : P\u1e17dasos is not odd.  As a further connection, the Harpy Pod\u00e1rg\u0113 (fem. of P\u00f3dargos) was the mother who gave birth to 2 swift horses (the father either Poseidon or Zephyrus), Balius and Xanthus who are associated with P\u1e17dasos.  P\u1e17dasos was mortal, and killed by a spear.  Balius and Xanthus were immortal, and wept at his death.  It is obvious that this is a version of the Indo-European Divine Twins (often part horse, or able to become horse; one knowing medicine and the other boxing/wrestling; one immortal, the other mortal (and dying, and/or restored to (partial or recurring) life when the other shared his immortality, born at the same time but of 2 different fathers, etc.).  If P\u1e17dasos was another name for Balius, it makes sense that the story of 2 horses, one immortal, the other mortal, changed in order to account for all the names as different figures (as gods with many names sometimes become multiple gods; it makes little sense for Achilles to have 3 horses when all other legends are about pairs, going back to PIE).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, separating P\u1e17dasos and P\u1e17gasos in these circumstances would be even more ridiculous.  P\u1e17gasos was also the son of Poseidon (and probably also of Medusa, originally), and brother of Chrysaor, a human.  This also is related to the Divine Twins as 2 part-horse humans or one full horse and one full human.  The similarity of this myth of a horse as brother to a human to that of Arion (a horse with at least one sister, possibly also a brother, whose parents were Poseidon and Demeter) might mean that, just as Arion has been compared to the Divine Twins, Chrysaor and Pegasus might represent Castor and Pollux.  Being carried by a flying horse to Olympus is like the mortal brother ascending to the sky after death, either resurrected or becoming stars ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/vfi3wo/etymology\\_of\\_chrysaor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/vfi3wo/etymology_of_chrysaor/) ).  Poseidon having at least 3 horse children with women who could represent the earth or animals seems unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA flying horse is nothing unusual in myth, but just as arg\u00ed-pous \u2018fleet-footed\u2019 could give the name of a flying horse, the Armenian for \u2018swift-winged\u2019 could name normal running horses (arciw \u2018eagle\u2019, loaned to Urartian ar\u1e63ibini (probably representing \\*arc\\^ivini), a horse).  G. aigupi\u00f3s \u2018vulture\u2019, Skt. \u1e5bjipy\u00e1-, Arm. arciw \u2018eagle\u2019 are all from \\*h2arg\\^iro-piyo- \u2018swift-winged\u2019 (compare G. \u014dkupter\u00f3s, L. accipiter \u2018hawk\u2019).  Either this is from \\*h2arg\\^iro-ptr-iyo- (the same \\*-iyo- optionally added in G. ox\u00fapous vs. L. acupedius \u2018swift-footed\u2019) with \\*ptr > \\*pr and dissimilation of r-r > r-0 or it is identical to \\*h2arg\\^iro-ped(iyo)- \u2018fleet-footed\u2019 with optional sound changes (see below).  That is, it\u2019s possible that a common word meaning \u2018swift\u2019 happened to be derived from \u2018foot\u2019, but was applied to all swift animals, regardless of their means of motion.  Without knowing what kind of changes or dissimilation occurred, it\u2019s hard to say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the details in sound changes, since P\u1e17gasos is the same as Doric P\u0101\u0301gasos and G. p\u0113d\u00f3s \u2018blade of an oar\u2019 is Doric p\u0101dos a traditional view might require a very specific sound change of \u0113 > \u0101 in Doric between p and b / d / g.  This is very unlikely, since \u0101 > \u0113 happened in some G., but not Doric, and since other PIE \\*Ced- words show the same change (\\*s\u0113d- \u2018seat\u2019 > OIc s\u00e6ti \u2018seat / hay heap\u2019, \\*s\u0101d- \u2018bottom\u2019 > W. sawdd \u2018depth\u2019) it seems normal PIE reconstruction is wrong here, and \\*Ced- words came from something like \\*Cext- or \\*Cex\\^t- with optional changes.  This \\*xt to either \\*d or \\*g explains the velar vs. dental alternation.  This is also seen in \\*wed- \u2018wet\u2019, really \\*wext-, to either \\*wedor- or \\*wexor- \u2018water\u2019, with nom. \\*vaar\u01dd in Skt.

        "selftext": "Salp and saupe don\u2019t look like words you\u2019d expect to be borrowed from Greek, but they definitely are.  Such odd words are often thrown away as Pre-Greek, with no further Indo-European source sought.  Although salps look very odd, indistinguishable to a casual observer from many invertebrates [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salp) , they are tunicates (from \u201ctunic\u201d).  These are members of the phylum Chordata, though not closely related to the animals usually called fish and sharks.  The exact relation doesn\u2019t probably doesn\u2019t matter for determining the origin of their name.  The use of a word for \u2018fish\u2019 to cover several unrelated species is not odd, even for invertebrates that live in water.  G. sarap\u00edous \u2018sprat\u2019, s\u00e1lp\u0113 \\\\ s\u00e1rp\u0113 \u2018salp/saupe\u2019 seem related.  It is unlikely 2 kinds of fish, both from not obviously IE roots, would look so similar if unrelated.  Using salt for the sea (and animals within it) is fairly common, and several paths might work.  Both sarap\u00edous & s\u00e1lp\u0113 \\\\ s\u00e1rp\u0113 with -ous and -lp- are not the sounds usually put together in G. and show variation sometimes said to be Pre-Greek (l vs. r).  I think they show by changes -os > -us, l > r, and Rp > RVp theorized for LA.  Since the sequence ou is used to represent u in dialects or non-Greek words, the presence of -ous which could be represented by -u supports previous theories (like Duccio Chiapello\u2019s theory that Kt\u1e17sarkhos \\\\ P\u0101\u0301sarkhos in both Linear A qa-sa-ra-ku and Linear B qa-sa-ko [https://www.reddit.com/user/stlatos/comments/13ij87b/linear\\_a\\_qasaraku\\_greek\\_kt%E1%B8%97sarkhos\\_p%C4%81sarkhos/](https://www.reddit.com/user/stlatos/comments/13ij87b/linear_a_qasaraku_greek_kt%E1%B8%97sarkhos_p%C4%81sarkhos/) among many others).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsidering the location of Perga, it might be expected to have borrowed words from Cypriot or even Cretan due to sea travel.

        "selftext": "When classifying languages, some myths with no basis in facts seem to have entered the beliefs of linguists.  Even when they clearly don\u2019t match the data, they\u2019ve apparently spread due to others reading and believing those who have examined the languages earlier, without checking the words themselves.  This is bad enough, but refusing to listen to corrections when an amateur points out the pros errors helps spread this misinformation.  For example, in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwomtari%E2%80%93Fas\\_languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwomtari%E2%80%93Fas_languages) the first sentence calls Kwomtari-Fas languages \u2018spurious\u2019 even when all linguists mentioned on the page class them together.  The reason is lower on that very page, due to an error in classing sub-groups, not the entire family.  That is, Kwomtari and Fas do not form a branch WITHIN Kwomtari-Fas (as mistakenly written in 1963), not that Kwomtari-Fas is completely wrong.  This error, and the little-known family itself, should hardly be known to most linguists, let alone the general public, yet somehow (maybe due to casual students looking only at the summary on wikipedia) this myth has remained and spread much more than you\u2019d think.  When talking about Kwomtari-Fas on Reddit I\u2019ve been told they\u2019re completely unrelated.  In [https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/vq2ihv/etymology\\_of\\_rainbow\\_niji/](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/vq2ihv/etymology_of_rainbow_niji/) Quarle claimed Fas was not Kwomtari at all, and that I should get help from an \u201cacademic\u201d to correct my mistakes, and even that I needed to learn the basics of the comparative method.  My attempts to correct people on this have been unsuccessful, and Quarle even said my words were \u201chostile\u201d simply because I did not immediately change my theory due to his mistaken \u201ccorrections\u201d.  Without being willing to believe you could be mistaken, you can never correct your own errors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilar myths in other families remain merely because they\u2019ve been repeated for years, not because they\u2019re true.

This is consistent with Dardic, Gypsy, Nur. having their separate sub-branch (not just Nur.) and the existence of optional sound changes across IE, often clear in Indo-Iranian due to the many languages and early attestation of variants.

George Abraham Grierson:  Dardic (including Kafiri = Nuristani) is a separate sub-branch of Indo-Iranian\n\n2.  Georg Morgenstierne:  Dardic (including Kafiri = Nuristani) are Indic\n\n3.  Georg Morgenstierne:  no, only Kafiri = Nuristani is a separate sub-branch of Indo-Iranian\n\n4.  R. Strand, Elena Bashir, etc., continued this work; they agreed with Morgenstierne even when giving data contrary to his views (many of these unexplained, as I\u2019ve shown; consider almost all entries in [https://nuristan.info/lngFrameL.html](https://nuristan.info/lngFrameL.html) with a ? in need of other explanation)\n\n5.  [https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/lex/languages](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/lex/languages) (probably Winfred P. Lehmann & Jonathan Slocum (who were listed as the organizers when I first examined this site around 2006)) say it\u2019s unclear where Dardic should be\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no data that supports Dardic being separate from Nuristani.  They share the same changes in many words.  Georg Morgenstierne simply said, with no evidence, that all data contrary to his views resulted from loans.  This would include:\n\nG. k\u00e9ras \u2018horn\u2019, Skt. \u015b\u00edras- \u2018head\u2019, Av. sarah-, Kh. s\u00f2r\n\n\\*h2rtk\\^o- > Kh. orts \\\\ \u00f2hts \u2018bear\u2019, Kv. \u00edts, Pl. i\u1e47\u1e6d\u1e63\n\nThese are not words likely to be loans, yet he needs \u00f2hts to be from Nuristani for ts (even though i- not o- there) and s\u00f2r from Iran. for s- (even with \u010d\u00e0xur \u2018spinning wheel\u2019 not showing a > o).

        "title": "Peter Zoller and the Bangani Conundrum",
        "selftext": "In the 1890\u2019s, a group of languages from Northwest India came to the attention of European scholars, though little was made of it at the time.  Distinct from neighboring Indic languages, they changed Proto-Indo-European k\\^ and g\\^ to ts and dz, part of the reason they were later classified in their own sub-branch.  In the 1990\u2019s Bangani, a language from the Himalayan region, showed yet another odd change, k\\^ and g\\^ to k and g, unlike any known Asian language.  Claus Peter Zoller was the first to discover these words, and he claimed that Bangani was related to Kashmiri, among other Dardic, and that it showed retained PIE k and g in some words.  This includes dukti \u2018daughter\u2019, not \\*duhit\u0101r; \\*g\\^lak\\^t > lOktO \u2018milk\u2019, etc.  This would be evidence that the major divide in IE, between Centum and Satem, was not absolute (part of a shift that new evidence began showing over the past century).  Zoller and others did not think these were native at first, maybe showing a Centum substrate, but in his more recent work it seems he\u2019s changed his mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite disputes that these words are real, even the opponents of this include some of his words in their data (George van Driem in [https://www.academia.edu/10165900/Some\\_grammatical\\_observations\\_on\\_Ba%E1%B9%85g%C4%81%E1%B9%87%C4%AB](https://www.academia.edu/10165900/Some_grammatical_observations_on_Ba%E1%B9%85g%C4%81%E1%B9%87%C4%AB) ) with no reason given for why they are not from the IE sources Zoller gave.  When I examined both Zoller\u2019s and van Driem\u2019s data, besides their stated matches they have so many similarities with Kashmiri and other Dardic languages in vocabulary, phonology, etc., that I can\u2019t imagine any other theory would fit.  These do have a number of more recent loans, but their old cognates are clear.  Zoller\u2019s evidence can hardly be false if it exists in Dardic, Rom. and Domaaki.  He has proposed nothing new, with much of the evidence for the same words from studies 100 years ago, so unless there is a giant conspiracy reaching throughout time and space, this seems to vindicate Zoller.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite van Driem\u2019s claims there is nothing wrong with the data, and this is not limited to Zoller, since others have gone to examine Bangani after hearing his words.  If you want more, see [http://websites.umich.edu/\\~pehook/bangani.hock.html](http://websites.umich.edu/~pehook/bangani.hock.html) & [http://websites.umich.edu/\\~pehook/bangani.zoller.html](http://websites.umich.edu/~pehook/bangani.zoller.html) or a 2nd person\u2019s data [http://www-personal.umich.edu/\\~pehook/bangani.abbi2.html](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pehook/bangani.abbi2.html) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCentum words in a supposed Indic language seem odd, but it can hardly be false with so many examples with no other explanation.  Indeed, Zoller also assumes many Dardic words were loaned into Romani, and these also show K\\^ > K.

        "selftext": "Yaron Matras has described Romani\u2019s similarity to Dardic as a result of late contact giving loans [https://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/whatis/language/history.shtml](https://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/whatis/language/history.shtml) .  Claus Peter Zoller has written about this and compiled more evidence [https://journals.uio.no/actaorientalia/article/view/5352](https://journals.uio.no/actaorientalia/article/view/5352) .  He also gives words which he takes as loans during a \u201cstopover\u201d.  Instead, I follow Grierson; they are related.  These similarities are too great to come from a period of contact; the cognates are too varied and basic to be loans.  It is far more likely for Indic to provide many loans into several groups than a minor (Dardic) giving so many to an Indic, etc.  Rom. n > m near dental matches possible \u1e47 > m near retroflex in Dardic.  In addition, the Domaaki language, still spoken in the same area as Dardic, has the same name as Rom (Skt. \u1e0dom(b)a- \\\\ \u1e0dumba- \u2018man of low caste who lives by singing and music\u2019) and shares features including vocabulary:  \\*plusima- > Dk. pur\u1e63um , Rom. pu\u0161um \u2018flea\u2019; \\*dwo:w > Kt. di\u00fa \u20182\u2019, Dk. d\u00fai, Rom. duy; \\*raudhi\u1e6da- > Skt. r\u00f3hita- \\\\ l\u00f3hita-, \\*lo\u00fchi\u1e37a- > A. loh\u00f3ylo \u2018red\u2019, Sh. lo\u00f3lyo, Dk. looy\u00e1, Rom. lolo; Skt. ak\u1e63\u00e1-s \u2018seed\u2019, Dk. akh\u00f3o \u2018walnut\u2019, Rom. akhor; PIE \\*bhabho- \u2018bean/berry/fruit\u2019 > T. bob\u01ddy, Ka. bubay \u2018apple\u2019, Dk. baba\u00ed, Rom. phabay; Skt. jy\u00f3tsn\u0101- \u2018moonlight\u2019, Dk. \u1e6d\u1e63on\u1e6d\u1e63 , Rom. \u010dhon \u2018moon / month\u2019; Skt. divas\u00e1-s \u2018heaven/day\u2019, Rom. dives, Dk. d\u00f3os; Sh. \\*b\u00edidhri-zra\u00e1n > bi\u1e93o\u00f3n \u2018rainbow\u2019, Rom. bri\u010d\u00edri (from Skt. v\u012bdhr\u00e1-, A. b\u00edidri \u2018clear sky\u2019 Sh. b\u00e9e\u1e93i \u2018fine weather / sunshine during rain\u2019).  These Dk. words often share features with Palola (\u00e1a > \u00f3o) which must show close contact or relation.  Since Palola is mentioned as the source of supposed loans into Rom. in [https://radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art\\_b\\_history\\_origins&lang=en&articles=true](https://radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_b_history_origins&lang=en&articles=true) it would show Romani\u2019s similarity to Domaaki was old.  This matches D. L. R. Lorimer saying that the Domaaki people were likely from the same source as the D.oms of India (making their living as musicians and blacksmiths, setttled among unrelated people), which is the standard origin of the Roms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZoller has written about Dardic etymology as well.  Without knowing it, some evidence he gives seems to show sound changes in common also:\n\n\\*k\\^h2akal- > Li. \u0161akal\u1ef9s \u2018splinter\u2019\n\n\\*k\\^h2akal- > \\*k\\^h2al- > Skt. \u015bal\u00e1-s \u2018staff/spear\u2019, \\*kxal- > \\*kxil- > Rom. kilo \u2018stake\u2019\n\nSkt. \u015bal\u0101k\u0101- \u2018small stake/stick/rod\u2019, Ks. \u0161u\u1e37\u00e1 \u2018wood\u2019\n\nwhich might show a to u by x (and u > \u00fc > u \\\\ i later) [https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/12tw1r1/x\\_marks\\_the\\_spot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/12tw1r1/x_marks_the_spot/) .  This also shows Rom. retained some PIE K\\^ as K, like Bangani [https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/12th870/peter\\_zoller\\_and\\_the\\_bangani\\_conundrum/](https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/12th870/peter_zoller_and_the_bangani_conundrum/) .  Other features show that Rom. was not Indic, with retention of clusters like dn > nd instead of Skt. dn > nn [https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/12stsgf/romani\\_dissimilation\\_and\\_metathesis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/12stsgf/romani_dissimilation_and_metathesis/) .  Some others:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRomani has been classified as descended from Middle Indic (or very similar) instead of having its old retained features acknowledged, leaving the reconstruction of Indo-European incomplete.  Some PIE C-clusters remain in Rom. even when never found in Indic at all, some close to Av.  Some of this is concealed by metathesis in one branch:\n\nG. m\u00fastax \u2018upper lip / mustache\u2019, \\*musk\u00e1- > Rom. mosko \u2018face/voice\u2019, Skt. mukh\u00e1-m \u2018mouth/face/countenance\u2019\n\n\\*karsto- > Rom. kar\u0161t / ka\u0161t, G. k\u00e1ston \u2018wood\u2019, Skt. k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1-m \u2018stick / (piece of) wood/timber\u2019, Arm. kask \u2018(chest)nut\u2019\n\n\\*per(s)ni- > Skt. p\u0101\u1e47\u00ed- \u2018hoof/hand\u2019, Kv. p\u0159\u00f5 \u2018foot of cow/horse\u2019, \\*parni > \\*pinro > Rom. pindro \u2018foot/sole\u2019\n\nSkt. chad- \u2018cover (over) / veil / hide / protect\u2019, \\*a-chda- > \\*adcha- > accha- \u2018clear\u2019, Hindi acch\u0101 \u2018good/fine/nice\u2019, \\*adcha- > \\*alcha- > Rom. la\u010dho\n\n\\*\u01ddbhk\\^ar-mo- > Av. f\u0161ar\u01ddma-, R. s\u00f3rom \u2018shame/disgrace\u2019, OE hearm \u2018distress/pain/damage/pity\u2019\n\n\\*\u01ddbhk\\^ar- > \\*\u01ddk\\^bhar- > Rom. azbal- \\\\ azbad- \\\\ azbav- \u2018hurt\u2019, \\*\u01ddbhk\\^ar- > \\*k\\^arbh- > Skt. \u015b\u00e1rb(h)ati \\\\ \u015b\u00e1rvati \u2018hurt/hit/kil\u2019\n\nEven changes like au > ou > \u014d are not found in the ancestor of Romani.

The \\*r not seen in Skt. but in Rom. might have disappeared long ago by uvular R > x > \\_ lengthening the V.  The presence of \\*s in mosko : mukh\u00e1-m could show that after retroflex s was created, the cluster \u1e63k became xk > kh in Skt. (like in kar\u0161t : k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1-m), which would help in identifying it with other IE changes of \u1e63 > x in Slavic, etc., and whether sr > str, \u1e63t > xt > t happend early enough for Skt. usra- \u2018ox/bull\u2019, u\u1e63\u1e6dra- \u2018camel\u2019, Av. u\u0161tra-, \\*uxtra- >> Ur. ultu to be an IE loan (like in \\*h2ausr- > OCS za u(s)tra \u2018in the morning\u2019, (j)utro \u2018morning\u2019, utr\u00ea \u2018tomorrow\u2019, Li. au\u0161(t)r\u00e0 \u2018dawn\u2019).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe change of Ch > -voice (dh > th, bh > ph, gh > kh) in Rom. is apparently regular, but opt. in most Dardic.

This devoicing is also optional in Dardic, so seeing the same in Indic could show that these Rom. changes were part of an ancient tendency that needs an explanation.  Further investigation could prove that one or two new sub-branches of Indo-Iranian are required for these groups.  This is important for the reconstruction of Indo-Iranian & all Indo-European, since some features here suggest that all aspirated stops were really fricatives in the past, often even patterning with v from w.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlb  Albanian\n\nArm  Armenian\n\nAro  Aromanian\n\nAsm Assamese\n\nAv    Avestan\n\nBal  Baluchi\n\nBe   Bengali\n\nBg   Bulgarian\n\nBu   Burushaski\n\nE     English\n\nG     Greek\n\nGo   Gothic\n\nH     Hittite\n\nHi    Hindi\n\nIs     Ishkashimi\n\nIt      Italian\n\nK      Kassite\n\nKd    Kurdish\n\nKho  Khotanese\n\nKu    Kusunda\n\nL      Latin\n\nLi     Lithuanian\n\nM     Mitanni\n\nMh   Marathi\n\nMArm  Middle Armenian\n\nMW   Middle Welsh\n\nNHG  New High German\n\nMHG Middle High German\n\nOHG  Old High German\n\nOBg   Old Bulgarian\n\nOIc    Old Icelandic\n\nOIr    Old Irish\n\nOE    Old English\n\nON   Old Norse\n\nOPr  Old Prussian\n\nOP   Old Persian\n\nMP  Middle Persian\n\nNP   (New) Persian (Farsi)\n\nNw  Norwegian\n\nOs   Ossetian\n\nPhr  Phrygian\n\nPs    Pashto\n\nR     Russian\n\nRu   Romanian\\\\Rumanian\n\nSar   Sarikoli\n\nShu  Shughni\n\nSkt   Sanskrit\n\nSog  Sogdian\n\nTA   Tocharian A\n\nTB   Tocharian B\n\nW   Welsh\n\nWx  Wakhi\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGy   Gypsy\n\nDv     Domari \\\\ Do:mva:ri:\n\nLv     Lomavren\n\nRom   Romani\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDardic Group\n\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atshareeta\u00e1 \\\\ (older Palola < \\*Paaloola\u00e1)\n\nB     Bangani\n\nBa   bHa\u1e6d\u00e9-sa z\u00edb \\\\ Bha\u1e6deri\n\nD    Degaan\u00f3  \\\\ Degano\n\nDk   Domaaki \\\\ Doma\u00e1 \\\\ D.umaki\n\nDm  Dameli\n\nGi   Gultari\n\nId    Indus Kohistani\n\nKa   Kalam Kohistani \\\\ Kalami \\\\ Gawri \\\\ Bashkarik\n\nKati\n\nKh\u00a0\u00a0 Khow\u00e0r\n\nKm  Kashmiri\n\nKt    kt\u00edvi k\u00e2t\u00e1 vari\n\nKv\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0K\u00e2mv\u00edri\n\nPl    Paaluula\u00e1\n\nNi    Ni\u0161ei-al\u00e2\n\nNp   Nepali\n\nSa    Sa\u0148u-v\u012bri\n\nSh\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shina\n\nTi    Torwali\n\nWg  Waigali \\\\ Kalas.a-al\u00e2",

Though they are both classified as Indic languages, these similarities are supposedly coincidental.  Even some words, like Sh. l\u00f3ko, Rom. lok\u00f3 \u2018light\u2019, are supposed to be borrowed, not native Indic.  These words are much closer than would be expected if the only relation was descent from Sanskrit, since other Indic languages have much different forms (KS mi\u0161\u1e6d \u2018good\u2019, Rom. mi\u0161to \u2018well\u2019 are from Skt. mi\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1- \u2018dainty / sweet/pleasant/agreeable\u2019, but other Indic show mi\u1e6d\u1e6dh-, etc., with loss of -s-).  I see too many shared features in vocabulary and sound changes (bh > ph, etc.) for their relation to not be acknowledged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome PIE C-clusters remain in Rom. even when never found in Indic at all, some close to Av.  Some of this is concealed by metathesis in one branch:\n\nG. m\u00fastax \u2018upper lip / mustache\u2019, \\*musk\u00e1- > Rom. mosko \u2018face/voice\u2019, Skt. mukh\u00e1-m \u2018mouth/face/countenance\u2019\n\n\\*karsto- > Rom. kar\u0161t / ka\u0161t, G. k\u00e1ston \u2018wood\u2019, Skt. k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1-m \u2018stick / (piece of) wood/timber\u2019, Arm. kask \u2018(chest)nut\u2019\n\n\\*per(s)ni- > Skt. p\u0101\u1e47\u00ed- \u2018hoof/hand\u2019, Kv. p\u0159\u00f5 \u2018foot of cow/horse\u2019, \\*parni > \\*pinro > Rom. pindro \u2018foot/sole\u2019\n\nSkt. chad- \u2018cover (over) / veil / hide / protect\u2019, \\*a-chda- > \\*adcha- > accha- \u2018clear\u2019, Hindi acch\u0101 \u2018good/fine/nice\u2019, \\*adcha- > \\*alcha- > Rom. la\u010dho\n\n\\*\u01ddbhk\\^ar-mo- > Av. f\u0161ar\u01ddma-, R. s\u00f3rom \u2018shame/disgrace\u2019, OE hearm \u2018distress/pain/damage/pity\u2019\n\n\\*\u01ddbhk\\^ar- > \\*\u01ddk\\^bhar- > Rom. azbal- \\\\ azbad- \\\\ azbav- \u2018hurt\u2019, \\*\u01ddbhk\\^ar- > \\*k\\^arbh- > Skt. \u015b\u00e1rb(h)ati \\\\ \u015b\u00e1rvati \u2018hurt/hit/kil\u2019\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven changes like au > ou > \u014d are not found in the ancestor of Romani.

Simple correspondences like \\*vi-\u1e63\u1e6da:va- > Kv. vi\u0161t\u00e1voa- \u2018praise\u2019, Rom. (a)\u0161arav are helpful when Rom. had dissimilation (v-v > 0-v).  Those that seem to show irregularities, like Rom.  barvalo \u2018rich\u2019, Skt. bh\u00e1gavant- \u2018fortunate/prosperous\u2019, are from changes that are seen in other Indo-Iranian languages, but not Indic, showing Rom.\u2019s separate status.  Even \u201cadded\u201d a- in Rom. matches i- / u- in Dardic, showing that this was not recent or restricted to one group.

        "selftext": "This is the made up language for use in whatever you want. \n\nName: Varkish\n\nPhonology:\n- Varkish has 18 consonants and 6 vowels.\n- Consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, f, v, s, z, sh, zh, h, m, n, ng, r, l.\n- Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y.\n- Syllable structure is (C)V(C).\n\nGrammar:\n- Varkish is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language.\n- Word order is flexible, but the default order is SVO.\n- There are no grammatical genders or noun classes.\n- Verbs are not conjugated for tense, but there are particles that can indicate when an action took place relative to the present.\n- There are no articles or definite/indefinite distinctions.\n- Nouns can be modified by adjectives, which come before the noun they modify.\n- There is no plural form of nouns. Instead, number is indicated through context or by using quantifiers like \"many\" or \"few\".\n- There are no prepositions. Instead, spatial relationships are indicated through postpositions that come after the noun they modify.\n- There is no copula verb. Predicate nominals are formed by juxtaposing the subject and the noun that describes it.\n\nVocabulary:\n- Varkish has a fairly simple vocabulary, with around 3,000 basic words. Many words are derived from roots by adding affixes.\n- For example, the root \"var\" means \"to speak\". Adding the suffix \"-ish\" creates the noun \"varkish\", which means \"language\".\n- Other common affixes include \"-er\" (agentive), \"-ish\" (adjectival), and \"-en\" (verbal).\n- Varkish tends to use compound words rather than relying on prepositions or other particles. For example, \"riverbank\" would be \"water-edge\" in Varkish.\n\nWriting system:\n- Varkish is traditionally written in a script that resembles Arabic or Persian calligraphy, with flowing lines and curves.\n- However, in modern times, a romanized script has become more common for everyday use.\n- Varkish has no capital letters or punctuation, although some modern writers may use them for clarity.",

        "selftext": "But even if you dedicate yourself daily, it's still not easy and most people fail or they peak and then start to forget/lose what they've learned. Why does this happen??\n\nI'll tell you why. **Because you're not immersed in the language that you are learning.** If I was learning Italian, and I moved to Italy, then with these tools I can learn Italian fluently. But if I try to learn Italian from America, sure I can memorize many words, but that doesn't mean that I will retain much since I'm not surrounded by the language.\n\nGet ready, I'm going to pitch something, but know that it's something that I truly created for myself at first to solve the exact issue from above. Except my issue was to not forget my native language of Romanian since I moved to America at a very young age, and in my adult life I speak Romanian to very few people and very rarely. So naturally, I started slipping. Every couple of years I would go back to visit Romania for about a month, and in that month of being immersed in the language, it came back sooo much more than if I were to just practice at home on my own.\n\n**Light bulb!!** What if I could stay immersed in the Romanian language even in America, every day. That would be cool. Well, what do I already do every day.....I have conversations through text messages every day!! These convos are in English, but what if I could see those convos in Romanian too. Ahhhhhhhhh!\n\nSo I developed a simple text messaging app, that my wife and I, and a couple of family/friends used. It does what I described above, it shows me my convos in another language as well. I ended up placing it on the App Store, Apple even featured it in the \"*New Apps We Love*\" section.\n\nYes, I'm promoting my app, but c'mon, this is so relevant for this community. So check it out if interests you, and I would love your feedback.\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatall/id1043435029](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatall/id1043435029)\n\nHere's a screenshot. I'm having a conversation in English on the left side, and on the right side my conversation is being translated in Spanish.\n\nThanks,\n\nAdrian\n\n**P.S.** I'm not competing with Duolingo or Rosetta Stone. Those are amazing tools that you should continue to use. But adding something like this to the mix will make a BIG difference.\n\n**P.S.S.** If you are on iOS 13 already, there is a small bug with the formatting. The blue header at the top is missing (it's actually transparent). An update with a fix is coming in the next couple of days :) Apple always breaks something with their new releases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wu7b0xmpp0p31.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f0b36bc163f08e8f44ef060b2853a776de8841",

        "selftext": "When we try to learn a new word or a language, we use the definition to help us understand the meaning of that word. However, where is the end to the definitions? If every word has a definition (contradictory to undefined terms that exist in geometry) then what words would you use in that definition without using the word you are trying to define. Let me show you an example. The word mathematics is defined as \"the science of numbers and their operations, interrelations, combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space configurations and their structure, measurement, transformations, and generalization\" (according to [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mathematics](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mathematics)). If you look in the definition and seem to not know what some of these words mean, you would continue to search them up. Now (for the sake of my argument) that you didn't know the definition of \"operations.\" When you go to look up this word you may see the following definitions: \"**1** **:** performance of a practical work or of something involving the practical application of principles or processes. Practice until you can go through the whole *operation* without hesitation or thinking. **2a** **:** an exertion of power or influence the *operation* of a drug. **b** **:** the quality or state of being functional or [operative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/operative) The plant is now in *operation*. **c** **:** a method or manner of functioning. a machine of very simple *operation.* **3** **:** [efficacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficacy), [potency](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/potency)  \u2014archaic except in legal usage. **4** **:** a procedure performed on a living body usually with instruments especially for the repair of damage or defect or the restoration of health needed an *operation* to remove his appendix.\" Seeing these definitions may make you say \"Well you see, mathematics was not used in any of the definitions, so you are clearly wrong.\" However, while that may be true, none of the definitions are the mathematical definition of the term. Therefore, you have not found your answer to the question \"What does operations mean in the context that it was used.\" Therefore, we proceed to look. The following definition says this \"any of various ***mathematical*** or logical processes (such as addition) of deriving one entity from others according to a rule.\" In this definition, I have clearly displayed that the word mathematical was used, and to this you may say that our original word was mathematics not mathematical. To that, my friend, I say: look up the word mathematical in the Merriam Webster dictionary. The definition of that word will contain the word mathematics in its definition. So there, this is the flaw in every language. The word you are trying to define is eventually defining itself, because it defines the words in its own definition. Credit goes to [https://www.merriam-webster.com/](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for the words and my source for this post. If you have anything to say about what I have written please let me know, I am open to whatever you have to say and any suggestions to improve my work. And please try this out on your own, I know it may seem boring, but it only takes a minute or so.",

You cannot ask for another round, so it is better to make sure that everything is working properly.\nb) Multitasking \u2013 The audio will be played only one time, hence it is very important for the candidate to hear properly in order to understand. Read the question and listen for the answers and write down words all at the same time.\nc) Promptness \u2013 IELTS Listening Practice transferring the answer as much as possible before the exam. Sometimes, the candidates who are slow in writing might find it difficult to transfer the answers in 10 minutes.\nd) No Blank \u2013 It is always advisable to write something rather than nothing, as there is no negative marking. Estimating the answer can help if the candidate misses listening to the answer.\ne) Capital Letter \u2013 It is recommended to write in capital letters as it is far clearer and easy to understand.\nf) Beware of the number of words \u2013 Each time the question type changes, the number of words for the answer might change too. For example, No more than three words or No more than two words.\ng) Spelling \u2013 It\u2019s important to check the spelling of a word while transferring the answer.\nh) Do not panic! \u2013 Section 4 is considered as the toughest due to the complexity of the lecture. The answers may come slowly as the listening proceeds. It is important for the candidate to listen and jot down by concentrating more.",

        "title": "Natural Languages and Noisy Channel: On and On, At Great Length",
        "selftext": "Learning a bit about Hammond Codes over the last few days: best I understand, it's a simple method to ensure that the sender builds a message - in this case, a short sequence of bits, known as the \"signal\" - with enough redundancy that a recipient can reconstruct a message that has errors due to having been sent along a noisy channel.  I will also talk about my favorite thing in the world, namely entropy.  \n\nHowever it makes me a bit interested in some broader issues about language.  Particularly, suppose that we consider language itself as the channel across which we are communicating \"signal\" - namely, idea.  I form an idea in my head and want to make the idea travel to your head.  The only way I have to do that is use language.  I'm interested in how far folks here think we can push the idea->signal and language->channel paradigm before it breaks (if it isn't broken out of the box).\n\nNow consider how redundancy might manifest itself in this model, in the form of (apparent) repetitiousness that actually is intended to ensure that the channel does not unduly garble the sender's message.  Suppose I wish to tell you that I will see you at 8 o'clock tonight:\n\nHigh redundancy/High fidelity/Low entropy: \" I will see you at 8 o'clock tonight. \"    (1)\n\nMedium redundancy/medium fidelity/medium entropy: \"See you at 8\"                   (2)\n\nMinimal redundancy/minimal fidelity/high entropy: \"c u @ 8\"                                  (3)\n\nThe relevance to Hamming codes being, that a mistransmission of any one symbol in (3) is likely to have a much greater negative impact on the decipherability of the message for the recipient, than in either (1) or (2) (though the effect of garbling the symbol \"8\" in any of the three cases is not good- more on that later).  Conversely, (3) is highest entropy because each symbol conveys a greater amount of information. \n\nIt is interesting to note that the cognitive process of \"unpacking\" the meaning in (3) is not unlike the process of reading even modern Chinese, which recent preliminary studies (for example, http://people.oii.ox.ac.uk/hanteng/2013/04/16/how-much-can-one-express-in-140-characters-comparison-between-english-and-other-languages-like-chinese/) have confirmed are indeed higher entropy/lower redundancy even in their modern forms. Like Chinese (especially Classical Chinese), (3) achieves a near 1-1 symbol-idea ratio.  While this 1-1 symbol ratio is maximally efficient with respect to the constraints of the technology used to transmit the language (bamboo sticks in the case of ancient Chinese, unused packet space in the case of text messages), it does come with several drawbacks:\n\n- Problem 1: corruption of any one symbol in (3) has a huge impact on the probability that the recipient will understand the message correctly:  \"c d @ 8\" is gibberish.\n\n- Problem 2: correct interpretation of (3) maximally depends on interpretation / insertion of meaning by the recipient.  This is the reason for the mental sensation of having to consciously \"unpack\" the meaning in either the text message-ish case in (3) or in many cases with Classical Chinese.  The sender is leaving much unspecified that the recipient has to reinsert into the message in order to make sense.  For lack of a better term I describe such forms of language as \"reader-intensive.\" \n\nWith respect to Problem 1:  the case of Chinese, it is interesting to hypothesize that the complexity of the construction of most ideograms in the language (measured by the number of strokes per character) might be an attempt to  compensate for small imperfections in transmission.    \n\nWith respect to Problem 2:  this has interesting implications for how language is used in various contexts, that I am only beginning to understand.  There are cases - science and law come to mind immediately - where it is extremely important that the idea X conveys to Y is understood by Y in the manner X \"intended it\" (there is a dreadful paradox here, see below).  We like to make fun of how verbose and pedantic laws are (in fact, it was a colleague's observation at of the verbosity of the law that prompted this note), but this verbosity and pedantry is nothing more than a reflection of the information-theoretic requirement to convey an idea \"without errors\": that is, if X is the person(s) who formulate a law pre/oscribing a behavior, X would very much like Y to behave accordingly.  Since laws exist to proscribe behaviors that would otherwise occur, they cannot leave anything beyond a bare minimum to the free interpretation of the reader: they must be minimally reader-intensive, minimally entropic, and therefore maximally redundant.  When we say a law is imprecise, what we really mean is that it is not minimally reader-intensive. \n\nIn the case of science, on the other hand, one cannot help but wonder whether the high entropy of written Chinese, and especially Classical Chinese - and the consequent (?) requirement that the receiver of the message actively unpack the meaning of the message - has something to do with arguments made last century that there was something about the Chinese language that was \"imprecise\" and retarded the advance of scientific discourse.  As arrogant as that argument seems, perhaps it bears some re-examination in this light.  I am not sure however whether there is necessarily a correlation between either high entropy and unreliability as a medium for the error-free communication of ideas : mathematical equations are high entropy yet low reader-intensive, and do a fine job of communicating ideas  On the other hand, math equations do not constitute a natural language. Perhaps the analysis is different for artificial languages, such as math.\n\nThe paradox underlying all of this is that it is impossible to talk about \"intended meanings\" without, well, talking about \"intended meanings.\" It is ultimately impossible to determine whether there is an \"idea\" or \"intention\" that exists independent of language, since we are all literate, in the sense that we all have language we use to communicate with each other, and even to communicate with ourselves.  Is even forming an idea a linguistic act, in which case the \"signal\"/\"channel\" distinction collapses and we must return to considering language the signal as is customarily done; or like the Daoists say, is there some \"way\" or \"idea\" that is beyond language, that language inevitably circumscribes, limits, but which one yet may approach with varying degrees of completeness through the adoption of different communication strategies (terseness/redundancy/etc)?  Part of the reason I don't like keeping a journal is that it only reinforces the impression that my entire world is limited to only those things that can be spoken.  Of course that's not entirely a bad thing: if the physicists are right that the universe is comprised entirely of information, that's still a very large upper bound. But still, a limit.",

        "selftext": "Now before I get downvoted to kindom come: I am not actively pursuing this, also his will probably never happen anyway. Also be open minded; personally I think it could look nice if tweaked to become an official revamp for our language. Also a a native Pole, I feel I have a right to be able to question such a matter without evoking too much butt-hurtedness. Either way please, lets all stay civil now. \n\nWithout further ado here it is:\n\nA [\u00c1] B C \u0106 \u010c D [\u010e] E [\u00c9] F G H I [\u00cd] J K L [\u013d- ?] M N \u0143 O \u00d3 [\u00d6] P R \u0154 S \u015a \u0160 T [\u0164-?]\u00a0U [\u00da] \u016c V Y Z \u017d\u00a0\u0179\n\nThe letters encased in [] are optional and I am not entirely sure if it is necessary, but phonetically speaking would improve pronunciation of hard or extended syllables. Others are simply added to remove digraphs such as io, jo, iu, ie, ij etc. And lastly, I do not think the Slovak counterpart makes the same sound, however I am curious as to whether or not \u013d could replace the Slavic Non-Palatal \u0141. Its not really a big deal, but it looks smoother to me; not as noisy as \u0141. \n\nAs for the missing \u0105 & \u0119. They're not gone, they have simply been replaced by a digraph that makes more linguistic sense. They [or should I say the sounds of] \u0105 & \u0119 would be replaced by diphthongs a\u016d & e\u016d. This is reminiscent of what the Belarussian language does with its \"\u045e,\" which is used in the diphthongs a\u016d, e\u016d, o\u016d. Like I stated before, this change is merely for the sake of better linguistic/orthographic flow. Who cares about heritage/word length etc, really. It will also make it easier for learners to read and even for Polish school children to learn the pronunciation of in primary Ed. So, this is a primarily functional rather than formal change. \n\nSo, with that I conclude my spare time progressive-reconstruction project of the lovely Polish orthography. I hope you enjoy it; please comment what you think! (: \n\nExtra thought as I am about to post this: what about a possibility of simply replacing \u0141 with o\u016d when not at the beginning of a word? Let me know what you think of this Reddit. :P\n\nDzi\u0119ki!\n\nAlso, here are some sample texts:\n\n**Nova Ortograf\u00eda dla Polski je\u016dzyk.**\n\n**Ide\u016d na spacer p\u0155ez Parku.** \u013dazienkovskiego.**\n\n**Dzie\u0144 dobry/ Mi\u013eego popo\u013eudn\u00eda.**\n\n**Rynek miasta jest cudovna.**\n\n**Pro\u015be\u016d p\u0155ekaza\u0107 mas\u013eo.**\n\n**Oni Ida\u016d/Ido\u016d na mala\u016d/malo\u016d podr\u00f3\u017ea**\n\nAs of yet, I am not sure if a\u016d or o\u016d is a more proper diphthong to replace \u0105.",

You'll have to remember these by repeatedly associating the symbol with the sound. \n\nSo...\n\n- \u0431 makes a \"b\" sound\n- \u0433 makes a \"g\" sound\n- \u0434 makes a \"d\" sound\n- \u0436 makes a \"zh\" sound\n- \u0437 makes a \"z\" sound\n- \u0438 makes an \"i\" sound\n- \u043b makes an \"l\" sound\n- \u043f makes a \"p\" sound\n- \u0443 makes a \"u\" sound\n- \u0444 makes an \"f\" sound\n- \u0447 makes a \"ch\" sound \n- \u044f makes a \"ya\" sound\n\n...
